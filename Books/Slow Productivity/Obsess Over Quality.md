Obsess over the quality of what you produce even if it means missing opportunities in the moment.

Quality demands that you slow down forcing you to steer further and further way from busyness.

Most knowledge workers don't do just one thing on which the workers performance is assessed.

Quality is directly linked with fighting off pseudo-productivity and embracing something slower.

No amount of grinding away at works will lead to improved tastes.

### Become a cinephile

Select a film you want to watch. Then go search up 5 to 10 reviews of the film preferably from a cinematography magazine. Then go watch the film and try to make note of the insights provided by the review.

There can be utility in immersing yourself in appreciation in creative fields different from your own. It can be daunting to study master works in your own creative field as you already know to much about it. Confronting the gap between your skills and a masters skills can be disheartening. When you study an unrelated field the pressure is reduced.

### Start your own inklings

When you gather with a collective of cohorts with similar professional ambitions the collective tastes of the group can be superior of any individual.

There is also a focusing effect that occurs when preforming in front of a crowd. You mind will slip into a "higher gear" than it would during solo introspection.

Forming a group of like minded professionals all looking to improve what they're doing provides short cut to improving your tastes.

### Invest in your tools

Using an expensive notebook, pens, inks, keyboards, or software can give a "I'm a professional" vibe which can be invaluable.

While having some skin in the game is important a similar benefit can be gained from computer programmers who create elaborate workstations or IDE/PDEs (I use neovim btw).

If you want your mind on board with your plan to improve your abilities then investing in your tools is a good way to start.

### Bet on yourself

The goal is to push yourself into a new level without pushing yourself into an unnaturally busy workload.

#### After the kids go to bed

In the evenings or during spare minutes throughout the day find time to work on a project you're passionate about.

The need to work on a project after hours is not unique to parents.

One of the easiest ways to bet on yourself is to temporarily dedicate free time to a something that interest you. If you fail to reach the quality you seek the only downside is that you, for a brief period, dedicated time to a project instead of something that could have been more rewarding.

If the activities you could be doing during that free time are sufficiently rewarding it can be used to motivate you to succeed.

This strategy is not a long term strategy. Sacrificing too much free time to extra work can violate the other 2 principals of slow productivity.

#### Reduce your salary

A more drastic option is to rely on your project for income. Few things motivate you as efficiently as the need to pay bills or buy food.

This, of course, is potentially dangerous. In American culture this is a romantic ideal of quitting your job to live your dream. There is immense appeal to upending your life in an effort to chase your passions. The problem of course is for every successful person who does this there are dozens of others who slink back to their previous lives deep in debt.

One way to do this is to extend the timeframe. Some people who make the transition will do it slowly over the course of years. Don't haphazardly quit your job to peruse a more meaningful project. Instead wait until you have observed the following:

1. People are willing to give you money for it
2. You can replicate the result

Once you've passed these thresholds take action. This may not mean quitting on the spot but you may want to take an unpaid leave.

#### Announce a schedule

Dedicating time or sacrificing money for a project are two obvious bets. A natural 3rd option is to leverage your social capital. If you announce you are working on something and then fail to accomplish it you will feel guilt or shame. This can act as a powerful motivator.

Announcing a schedule works at different scales.

It could be as small as a screen writer announcing a reading at small theater.

It could be as large as a CEO announcing the release of a new product an upcoming event.

#### Investments

Having someone invest money in your and your project can be a great motivator to force you to produce a high quality product.

Money is not always required. Getting someone to invest time in helping you can also be an equally powerful motivator.
