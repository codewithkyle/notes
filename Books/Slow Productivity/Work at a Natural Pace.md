Approach your work with a slower more natural pace. Become conferrable with taking longer on an important project

### Make a 5 year plan

Most people restrict their long term planning to the next few months. Planning at this scale is important but planning on a longer scale is also important.

### Double your estimates

Focus on projects you will complete within the next few months.

Take whatever timelines you first identify as reasonable for projects and then double their length.

For example, if you think it will take 2 weeks to launch a new website double it to take a whole month.

If you think it's reasonable to write 4 book chapters in 2 months change the requirements so that you only need to write 2 chapters.

Humans are natively wired to accurately estimating physical labor. You are not great at estimating the effort it will require to complete knowledge work. You are guessing more than you may realize. We seem to seek the thrill of imagining a wildly ambitious timeline. It feels good in the moment but sets us up for long-term failure.

**Grand achievements is built upon completing modest results over time**

### Simplify your workday

Toning down your seasonal and long term plans won't help if you continue to cram work into every hour of every day. All 3 timescales must be tamed together.

1. Reduce the number of tasks you schedule
2. Reduce the number of appointments on your calendar

Tl;DR - reduce obligations to increase your available work time

#### Implementation

Observe how many tasks you take on average per day and slash that number by 25% - 50%.

Humans are bad at estimating how much knowledge work they can handle within a given day. Blanket reduction rules counteract this bias.

As for appointments ensure no more than 50% of your work day is booked. The easiest way to achieve this is to mark hours as "protected" (e.g. no meetings before noon).

If you cannot protect your time instead try a tip for tat strategy. For every meeting you accept for a day block an equal amount of time for work.

This is not a silver bullet. You will still have days full of meetings and last minute urgent tasks.

### Forgive yourself

Sometimes you'll miss deadlines. Sometimes a project will drag on far to long. Sometimes you'll procrastinate.

You may feel temped to overload your self with busy work as a way to pay penance. Push back on this feeling. Not only is it unsustainable but it won't make you more productive in the long run.

Take a deep breath. Forgive yourself. Then ask "what's next"?

The key to meaningful work is returning to the efforts you find important. Not getting everything right every time.

### Embrace seasonality
