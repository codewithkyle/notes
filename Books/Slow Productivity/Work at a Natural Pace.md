Approach your work with a slower more natural pace. Become conferrable with taking longer on an important project

### Make a 5 year plan

Most people restrict their long term planning to the next few months. Planning at this scale is important but planning on a longer scale is also important.

### Double your estimates

Focus on projects you will complete within the next few months.

Take whatever timelines you first identify as reasonable for projects and then double their length.

For example, if you think it will take 2 weeks to launch a new website double it to take a whole month.

If you think it's reasonable to write 4 book chapters in 2 months change the requirements so that you only need to write 2 chapters.

Humans are natively wired to accurately estimating physical labor. You are not great at estimating the effort it will require to complete knowledge work. You are guessing more than you may realize. We seem to seek the thrill of imagining a wildly ambitious timeline. It feels good in the moment but sets us up for long-term failure.

**Grand achievements is built upon completing modest results over time**

### Simplify your workday

Toning down your seasonal and long term plans won't help if you continue to cram work into every hour of every day. All 3 timescales must be tamed together.

1. Reduce the number of tasks you schedule
2. Reduce the number of appointments on your calendar

Tl;DR - reduce obligations to increase your available work time

#### Implementation

Observe how many tasks you take on average per day and slash that number by 25% - 50%.

Humans are bad at estimating how much knowledge work they can handle within a given day. Blanket reduction rules counteract this bias.

As for appointments ensure no more than 50% of your work day is booked. The easiest way to achieve this is to mark hours as "protected" (e.g. no meetings before noon).

If you cannot protect your time instead try a tip for tat strategy. For every meeting you accept for a day block an equal amount of time for work.

This is not a silver bullet. You will still have days full of meetings and last minute urgent tasks.

### Forgive yourself

Sometimes you'll miss deadlines. Sometimes a project will drag on far to long. Sometimes you'll procrastinate.

You may feel temped to overload your self with busy work as a way to pay penance. Push back on this feeling. Not only is it unsustainable but it won't make you more productive in the long run.

Take a deep breath. Forgive yourself. Then ask "what's next"?

The key to meaningful work is returning to the efforts you find important. Not getting everything right every time.

### Embrace seasonality

No employer will agree to giving an employee an "off season" where they take on a reduced workload. To work around this select a time of the year and during that time find ways to ramp down the work you take on without telling anyone (e.g. temporarily "quiet quit").

Most people naturally do this towards the end of the year. If you pay attention you may notice that towards the end of November people do not typically start new projects until early to mid January. The week between Christmas and New Years is an especially slow week.

One tactic is to take on a highly visible but low effort project during your off season. Don't reject new work but make sure people know you're already working on something important.

> Sure I can take on these reports after I finish my training on this new marketing software. Let's wait until the new year to get started.

The key is to chose a deflection project that doesn't require a lot of messages, meetings, or collaboration.

A boss may notice if you're always working at a slower pace but a month or two should fly under the radar.

#### Define a shorter work year

When interviewing for new position consider negotiating a 10 month work year.

This can be easier achieved by becoming your own boss by starting a company or working as a freelancer.

#### Implementation

While embracing periods of "quiet quitting" when the entire company is slowing down during the end of year holidays can help reduce the stress and burden of endless urgent tasks there are other ways to implement seasonality on a smaller time scale.

Spending 2 months away can reduce the stress but so can "small seasonality" by taking off 1 or 2 week days a month.

##### No meeting Mondays or Fridays

Reduce the stress you feel on Sunday nights by ensuring you have a slow and undisturbed Monday. People shouldn't be too put off by this since it's only 20% of the week so it's not like you're being unreasonable.

Alternatively avoiding meetings on Fridays can help you shift out of "work mode" and into "weekend mode" easier.

##### See a matinee once a month

Once a month leave work early to see a matinee or to do some other social event that is typically reserved for after work or weekends.

Block the time out on your calendar as "Appointment" and no one should think twice about where you are or why you're gone. If it's a particularly busy week consider pushing back your "Appointment" by a week.

If you feel guilty take a moment to consider how many times you read or respond to messages or emails outside your work hours.

You can get similar benefits by going to museums, hikes, or to the zoo.

The key observation here is that even a modest schedule with breaks can combat the exhaustion of an other metronome routine.

##### Schedule rest projects

It can be stressful blocking out major chunks of time on your calendar for a new project. Each new meeting you add is less time you have to work. As your schedule fills during busy periods a sense of despair can arise.

One way to combat this is to pair a "work project" with a "rest project". Towards the end of a major work project schedule time on your calendar for something leisurely and unrelated to your work.

##### Work in cycles

If you can swing it work in 6-8 week cycles followed by a 2 week "cool down" period where employees can catch up on minor tasks or focus on unrelated work they find interesting.

If you cannot implement a cycles based work system within your company or team you can implement on for yourself. The 2 week cool down period is not long enough for you to gain a reputation as someone who shirks responsibility and the intense effort you put in during the 6 to 8 week periods will be noticed more.

##### Match your space to your work

An advertising executive may find inspiration in a Mad Men style office decor.

A music executive may fill their office with instruments.

A mechanical engineer may fill their office with complex diagrams or half assembled gadgets.

Remote work != work from home. When at home you will be constantly context switching between home mode and work mode. Every time you walk to the bathroom you may notice a pile of dirty cloths and it will trigger your brain to switch out of work mode and into an overwhelmed "oh my gosh I have so many chores to do today" home mode.

Most famous and successful writers who where the OG "remote workers" chose not to work within their lavish home offices. Many would work in their garden sheds, in hotel rooms, or they would rent spaces they could retreat to in order to avoid dealing with anything that would pull them back into home mode.
