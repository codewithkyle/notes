## Key Principals

1. Do fewer things.
2. Work at a natural pace.
3. Obsess over quality.

## General Assumptions

Made by managers/leadership about knowledge workers.

1. Work is a vague thing employees do in an office.
2. More work = better results.
3. It's a manages job to make sure more work is getting done.
4. Lazy employees will do the bare minimum.
5. The best companies have the hardest workers.

## What is "productivity"

When asked most people respond with a definition of their job:

> Producing content and services to the benefit  the member organizations - Executive

> Planning sermons while attending to your flock via personal visits - Pastor

> Attending meetings and reviewing peer articles - Researcher

> Doing what you said you would do - Engineering Director

People often don't provide any metrics or specific goals that could be met. They don't define what it means to do the job well vs badly. When quantity is mentioned people always say more = better.

**Knowledge workers don't have a clear definition of what "productivity" means.**

Managers don't know how to measure knowledge worker productivity. When they do they use silly metrics like "number of lines of code written" or "tasks complete".

Physical labor has clear metrics (e.g. number of strips printed per hour). Managers can then tweak the layout or process to see if productivity goes up or down.

In factory work an employee is responsible for performing 1 specific task. This allows individuals to identify specific areas/jobs that can be improved/modified. 

> A steel mill productivity consultant identified an opportunity to improve the design of the shovel use to pick up slag. After testing he created a shovel that could pickup 21lbs of slag (optimal shovel load) without adding additional strain or fatigue on the worker.

Knowledge workers are responsible for complicated and constantly shifting workloads. There is no clear single output to track. Even if you do identify something to track it's impossible to control for the impact of additional obligations.

In a factory managers and consultants can create optimized workloads and processes. In knowledge work companies will often dictate what software a worker must use, however, deciding how to assign, organize, collaborate, and execute work is left up to the individual.

> The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail. He can only be helped but he must direct himself. - Effective Executive

Managers didn't know how to manage knowledge workers and knowledge workers didn't know how to manage themselves. From this uncertainty a simple alternative emerged: using visible activity as a crude proxy for actual productivity. The more activity you see the more I'm contributing to the companies bottom line, right?

Throughout the 20th century this became the dominate way to track knowledge worker productivity.

#### Pseudo-Productivity
*The use of visible activity as a primary means of signaling productive effort.*

> It seems like the benefits of technology have create the ability to stack more onto our day and our schedules than we have the capacity to handle while maintaining a level of quality that makes the things worth doing. I think that's where the burnout comes from. When you want to care about something but you're removed the the capacity to do it properly and give it your passion because you're expected to do so many other things.

Knowledge workers have so many ongoing and competing tasks they struggled to identify and prioritize any of them.

## Do Fewer Things

Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing them with time to spare. Dedicate your time and energy to the projects that matter most.

At work busyness seems unavoidable but if you're willing to be creative and, at time, radical in how you think about selecting and organizing your work it is possible.

During the first few months of the pandemic Microsoft released a work trends report revealing employees spent 2.5x more time in meetings with the quantity of emails and IMs also exploded. The digital intensity of a workers day has drastically increased.

### Why did this happen?

In knowledge work when you agree to a new task or commitment it brings with it a certain amount of ongoing administrative overhead. Back and forth emails, IMs, and meetings. As the todo list grows so does the total amount of overhead tax on the worker. Because the number of hours in a workday are fixed this reduces the overall amount of time available to the worker for accomplishing the task.

At moderate workloads this feel frustrating. As the work load increases the overhead tax will eventually surpass a tipping point at which logistical efforts will outweigh the upkeep of old tasks compared to the new tasks.

This feedback loop can quickly get out of control. This is typically how work gets pushed into adhoc hours performed on weekends or outside of work hours (early mornings or evenings).

### Shift towards remote

Just prior to the pandemic knowledge workers had already started to push their workload to the overhead tax tipping point (the maximum amount of admin overhead that allowed them to keep up). As the overhead tax increased due to new rules around response times (emails and IMs) and the fact that most meeting software requires you to schedule meetings in 15 to 30 minute blocks reduced what remaining time workers had during the day to focus on their tasks to the point where most of their time was spent performing administrative functions.

### Game of chicken

Sprinting towards the overhead tax tipping point is a crazy way to run a business and our lives.

Lets look at some numbers:

You are tasked with writing a report. Each report takes 7 hours of focused work to complete. Each report generates 1 hour of overhead tax via emails and meetings.

> Overhead tax will expand to fill as much time as is provided. Until the underlying task is complete it will continue to generate additional overhead tax through additional emails, messages, and check-in meetings.

If you commit to 1 report at a time, giving it your full mental capabilities and attention until it's done. You'll complete 1 report a day.

If you agree to take on 4 reports at the same time the combined overhead tax generated by all 4 reports will eat up 1/2 your day. Effectively doubling the total time required to complete a single report.

### Doing fewer things = more results.

The advantage is not just more things get done but also the quality of the work is improved. When you approach a project without the need to hurriedly attend many needy fires you enjoy an expanded sense of experimentation and possibility. You have he capacity to identify improvements or strategies that would have alluded you in a more fragmented state of attention. There are also neurological benefits  such as reducing the impacts of cortisol when your schedule becomes overly full or the rich semantic connections you mind can make among your brains neurons.

TL;DR - our brains work better when we're not rushing.

### Misconceptions

Do fewer things != accomplish fewer things.

You do not work fewer hours when doing fewer things. Instead you simply spend the same amount of hours focused on a few specific tasks.

### Benefits

Doing fewer things makes us better at our jobs. Focusing on one thing at a time and continuing until completion is objectively a better way to work.

Workers will have more energy because they will not be burdened with as much overhead tax.

Workers will be able to achieve and revel in a sense of accomplishment when their task is completed which will release neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin.

### In the workplace

When left to our their own devices knowledge workers will calibrate their workloads to the exact edge of the overhead tax tipping point. One would expect to see workers on either side either well below the tipping point or burning up and out. However, most workers who have some autonomy over their workload and schedule tend to land right on the point of having too much to do yet they don't tip over to the point where reform is required.

Many will point to an exploitive entity such as a manager who's only goal is to extract as much value as possible from our labor. These frameworks where created in a strictly control environment such as manufacturing and later expanded to include the hourly wage service sector apply at best to the autonomy and ambiguity of knowledge work.

For many knowledge workers tasks are not always assigned directly to you by a stop watch wielding manager. Instead they're thrown at you haphazardly from all directions: collogues, HR, clients.

In factories pushing employees to work longer hours or additional shifts can directly be more profitable. In knowledge work by contrast pushing employees into larger workloads can reduce the quantity and quality of the work produced.

#### How do knowledge workers decide to say no?

In the modern office context workers rely on stress as a heuristic to when they can say no. The worker saying no needs to feel an equal or greater amount of distress that will be applied to the worker receiving the 'no' before they're conferrable saying it.

The obvious problem is that workers will not begin saying no until they're already overloaded and overstressed.

The informal manner of how knowledge workers manage their workloads ensures they're always dangerously close to being overloaded.

#### Skunkworks

1. Decline any/every meeting you can.
2. Work from home whenever possible.
3. Reduce the number of big items pulling at your attention.
4. Systematically produce smaller pieces of a bigger project that you've already completed ahead of time.

Following these steps will provide you the best possible opportunity to ensure you have a large chunk of undisturbed time that you can spend focusing on something you deem important.

##### Limit missions

Limit taking on any tasks or goals that do not directly effect your career/business goals. There is a desire to limit yourself to only taking on 1 mission at a time yet access to this is restricted to very few people typically ones in highly creative fields or solopreneurs.

Most people take on 2 or 3 missions at a time.

##### Limit projects

Limit taking on any projects that is to say limit work that cannot be completed within any 1 work session.

One strategy to limit how many projects you take on is to be an annoying unresponsive person. When someone requests something of you do not respond to them. Tell everyone you are irresponsible. Leave people on read for days or weeks.

This of course takes a lot of time and energy if you are not naturally a unresponsive and irresponsible person and the facade will eventually fall.

Another strategy is to appeal to the reality of your unimpeachable actual available time. If someone asks you to do something and you appeal to some vague sense of time you're unlikely to succeed. However, you instead of a reputation as someone who is careful with their time and can quantity your busyness more concretely you will be more likely to succeed in avoiding the new work. When you say "I don't really see any significant amount of open time to work on this for at lest 3 weeks" and at the same time you have several open projects competing for that time already on your schedule it's hard for them to rebut you. Unless they're willing to challenge your calculations or force you to work extra hours.

To gain this credibility when taking on a new project estimate how much time it will take and then go find that time on your calendar. Block off the time as you would for a meeting. If you're unable to find enough black space then you don't have enough time for it. Either say no or cancel something else to make room for it.

This is not something you need to do indefinitely. Once you've done it a few times you'll have a general idea of how many projects you can take on a once. Once you've passed your limit you'll know you can reject the request.

##### Limit daily goals

Work on at most 1 project per day. This won't be the only work you do for the day you'll still need to respond to emails, messages, and attend meetings but it should be the only project focused work you do for the day.

### Put tasks on autopilot

When you need to do the same work or type of work each week strive to do this work at the same time on the same day and even in the same location.

For example consider sending all the invoices for the previous week out at the same time on every Monday morning.

A key aspect is to link rituals with locations. It's easier to fall into a regular low stress rhythm when this link is active. A ritual can be something as simple as eating lunch outside on a bench then walking to the west side of the building to get a cup of coffee before sitting down to work on a weekly report.

You should seek out opportunities to create as many autopilot tasks as possible.

### Synchronize

A common scenario a knowledge workers will find themselves in is someone needs them to do something. However, they need clarification so they ask the requester. This person then needs to forward the question to someone else who many or many not need to also forward the question. A game of telephone quickly breaks out and a ton of time is wasted at each level while everyone awaits the response.

The good news is the delay in this asynchronous communication many lead knowledge workers into thinking they're overloaded when they're really just idle. The solution of course is to replace the asynchronous communication with synchronous communication such as a call or in person conversation.

This obviously is a double edges sword. The saying "could have been an email" didn't come from nowhere. If you're not careful you may trade an inbox full of emails with a calendar full of meetings. A fate arguably just as dire.

The solution for this is "office hours". Set aside the same time block every day and communicate these hours with our coworkers and clients. Keep your door open, messenger status active, and calendar clear. Then when someone needs your help tell them "happy to help come grab me during one of my upcoming office hours".

This can also be useful for teams in a "docket clearing meeting". At the same time each week get everyone together and work through a shared document from top to bottom. When the document is empty everyone can go.

### Make other people work more

Create rules and processes for how tasks enter your queue.

In general strategies that require people to do more work can be effective in deflecting people who are seeking to have you do tasks for them.

1. Create a public task list
2. When someone asks you to take on some small obligation direct them to the public task list and ask them to add it themselves
3. Make it clear that all the information needed to complete the tasks needs to be in the task description

This forces people to spend more time clearly defining what they need from you. This simplifies the later execution of their task.

This public list can also be use to keep people updated on the status of their task. Saving them from having to bother you with status check-in messages or emails.

Ideally when a coworker sees an overstuffed task list they should think twice before piling on additional work for you to do.

Try to create a process that requires the requester to do some of the upfront work for the task. Not enough that they'll complain about it but enough to make your execution of the task easier.

Your peers may end up enjoying working with you more because of the added structure. It clearly signals to them how and when you'll work on their request.

In general people are so focused on their own problems that they don't have time to focus on how you're solving your problems.

### Avoid task engines

Most people focus on the task list at hand yet a surprisingly successful strategy can be shifting your focus upward towards the source of new tasks.

When selecting new projects assess your options by the number of weekly requests, questions, or chores you expect the project to generate.

Most people focus on the difficulty of a project or the total amount of time it might require.

Consider two roles on a project to integrate with a courier service. The first role is the developer role in which the goals and requirements are clearly laid out at the onset of the project. The other is the project manager role.

The project manager will need to attend several meetings with both internal and external people. They will need to be in constant communication with dozens of people at various levels of seniority. The project manager role is a task engine. Throughout the lifecycle of the project it will generate many small yet urgent tasks.

The developer role on the other hand will primarily consist of undisturbed focused work. It generate very few urgent small tasks. The underlying work may be more difficult but the decision to chose it over the project manager role shouldn't be.

### Spend money

Some business owners have found that spending money for the "pro" subscription of various software services reduce the overhead tax from their tax lists compared to those who try to bleed every drop of value out of the free tier. 

This also goes for people, both contractors and employees. Spend more money hiring better people to produce a higher quality output instead of hiring cheap labor to slowly grind out crap.

### Pull instead of push

If you find yourself in a system bogged down by it's own obsessive ambition consider a pull based model instead of a pushed based one.

New tasks are assigned by workers pulling work when they're ready for it. A Kanban board can be created with columns for each stage of the process. When workers are available they'll pull a task through the board going from column to column. For a task to move from one column to the next the team lead must identify a worker that has availability to take on the new task. If no one is available the task stays in place and no new work is pulled into the column. Workers can be temporarily relocated to other columns to help clear out stuck tasks.

The key to these systems is to prevent an unbounded amount of work from being pushed down through the pipe and overfilling any individuals plate.

#### Simulating a pull based system within a push based system

While less ideal and efficient than working in a proper pull based system a team or individual can simulate a pull based system within a push based one.

##### Holding Tank & Active List

Track all projects you're currently committed to on a list consisting of 2 sections: Holding Tank and Active.

When a new project is pushed onto you place it in the Holding Tank section of your list. This section has no upper bound.

The Active section of the list should have 3 projects at most at any given time. When a slot opens up pull a project from the Holding Tank up to the Active list. If a large project is sitting in the Holding Tank you may want to pull up only a part of the project into the Active list.

For example if "write book" is in the Holding Tank and a slot opens up you may want to pull "write chapter 2" into the Active list.

In maintaining these two lists you're simulating the core dynamic of a pull based system. The number of active things you are working on is limited to a small quantity freeing you from a sense of frenzied overload and minimizing the overhead tax. The problem of course is coworkers or clients who don't know about your simulated system who get frustrated at the lack of progress on their demands. To avoid this combine your list with a smart intake procedure.

##### Intake Procedure

When adding a new project to your Holding Tank be sure to inform the source of the project about what they should expect. To do so send an acknowledgement message about the project you're going to complete. It should also include the following pieces of information:

1. A request from the source of any additional details needed before you can begin the project
2. A count of existing projects already on your list
3. An estimate of when you expect to complete this new work

After sending this message label the project with a time estimate included in your acknowledgement message so you won't later forget.

> Hi Josh, I wanted to follow up on our conversation from yesterday afternoon about adding SSO to the GPC Asset Tracking website. At the moment I have 2 other projects queued up ahead of this and based on my estimates my best guess is that I'll be able to start working on this early next week. I will update date you if this estimate changes.

If you fall behind on a project update the estimate and inform the person who originally sent you the work about the delay. Transparency is the key. Be clear about what is going on and deliver on your promises even if these promises have to change. Never let a project fall through the cracks and hope no one calls you on it.

This works because we misconceive our notions about others wanting work from us as fast as possible. This isn't true. Often what people want is to hand something off and know it will get done. If they trust you they'll give time to finish things on your own terms.

**Relief trumps expediency**

##### List Cleaning

Once a week you should have an autopilot task to review and clean your list. You should review upcoming deadlines, prioritize what is due soon, and send updates for projects you know you won't be able to complete on time.

This is also a good opportunity to remove from your Holding Tanks projects that are languishing. If you delay a project time and time again it's a good sign that you're not really equip to handle it or the task falls outside your comfort zone. You should talk to the source of the project and see if they'll release you from your obligation.

> I know I said I would work on the new GPCO website but I've found myself as your undoubtedly noticed delaying this work again and again. I think this is sign that I don't really know enough about what we're trying to accomplish here to make progress. Unless you object I'd like to take this off my list for now. I think we probably need to engage help from X to make real progress on this goal.

When cleaning your list look for projects that have become redundant or have been rendered obsolete. In these cases remove the outdated projects but before you do so send a note to their original source.

Maintaining a pull based workflow only works if you maintain transparency.
