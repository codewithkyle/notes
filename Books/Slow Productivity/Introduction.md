## Key Principals

1. Do fewer things.
2. Work at a natural pace.
3. Obsess over quality.

## General Assumptions

Made by managers/leadership about knowledge workers.

1. Work is a vague thing employees do in an office.
2. More work = better results.
3. It's a manages job to make sure more work is getting done.
4. Lazy employees will do the bare minimum.
5. The best companies have the hardest workers.

## What is "productivity"

When asked most people respond with a definition of their job:

> Producing content and services to the benefit  the member organizations - Executive

> Planning sermons while attending to your flock via personal visits - Pastor

> Attending meetings and reviewing peer articles - Researcher

> Doing what you said you would do - Engineering Director

People often don't provide any metrics or specific goals that could be met. They don't define what it means to do the job well vs badly. When quantity is mentioned people always say more = better.

**Knowledge workers don't have a clear definition of what "productivity" means.**

Managers don't know how to measure knowledge worker productivity. When they do they use silly metrics like "number of lines of code written" or "tasks complete".

Physical labor has clear metrics (e.g. number of strips printed per hour). Managers can then tweak the layout or process to see if productivity goes up or down.

In factory work an employee is responsible for performing 1 specific task. This allows individuals to identify specific areas/jobs that can be improved/modified. 

> A steel mill productivity consultant identified an opportunity to improve the design of the shovel use to pick up slag. After testing he created a shovel that could pickup 21lbs of slag (optimal shovel load) without adding additional strain or fatigue on the worker.

Knowledge workers are responsible for complicated and constantly shifting workloads. There is no clear single output to track. Even if you do identify something to track it's impossible to control for the impact of additional obligations.

In a factory managers and consultants can create optimized workloads and processes. In knowledge work companies will often dictate what software a worker must use, however, deciding how to assign, organize, collaborate, and execute work is left up to the individual.

> The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail. He can only be helped but he must direct himself. - Effective Executive

Managers didn't know how to manage knowledge workers and knowledge workers didn't know how to manage themselves. From this uncertainty a simple alternative emerged: using visible activity as a crude proxy for actual productivity. The more activity you see the more I'm contributing to the companies bottom line, right?

Throughout the 20th century this became the dominate way to track knowledge worker productivity.

#### Pseudo-Productivity
*The use of visible activity as a primary means of signaling productive effort.*

> It seems like the benefits of technology have create the ability to stack more onto our day and our schedules than we have the capacity to handle while maintaining a level of quality that makes the things worth doing. I think that's where the burnout comes from. When you want to care about something but you're removed the the capacity to do it properly and give it your passion because you're expected to do so many other things.

Knowledge workers have so many ongoing and competing tasks they struggled to identify and prioritize any of them.
