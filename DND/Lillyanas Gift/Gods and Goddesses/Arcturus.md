Arcturus is a god who has existed since the beginning of time, born from the first light of the universe. He is often depicted as an old man with a long white beard, wearing a cloak of stars. His eyes are bright and wise, and his voice carries the weight of eons.

Arcturus is a god of knowledge and wisdom, and is revered by scholars, philosophers, and astronomers alike. He is said to have created the stars themselves, and to guide them in their paths through the heavens. It is said that Arcturus has mapped out the entire universe in his mind, and that he possesses knowledge that is beyond the comprehension of mortal minds.

Despite his immense power and knowledge, Arcturus is a humble and compassionate god. He is the protector of all that is good and just, and is said to take a personal interest in the affairs of mortals. Arcturus is often called upon by those who seek guidance and wisdom, and his followers believe that he will guide them on their journeys through life.

Arcturus is also associated with time and the cycles of the universe. He is said to be the master of the stars' movements, and to have the ability to bend time to his will. It is said that Arcturus can perceive the past and the future, and that he can manipulate time to bring about the best possible outcomes for his followers.

Those who worship Arcturus often build observatories and study the stars, seeking to gain knowledge and insights into the workings of the universe. They leave offerings of incense and candles at his temples, and pray to him for guidance and wisdom. Arcturus is known to be a benevolent god who rewards those who seek knowledge and live justly, but his wrath can be fearsome to behold for those who act unjustly or misuse their knowledge.

The holy symbol of Arcturus is a celestial depictionâ€”a radiant, eight-pointed star surrounded by a delicate circle. Each point of the star represents a cardinal direction, symbolizing the god's omnipresence and influence across the universe. The circle embodies the eternal and cyclical nature of time, a reflection of Arcturus' mastery over the celestial cycles.
