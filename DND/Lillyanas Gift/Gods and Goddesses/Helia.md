Helia is a radiant goddess with golden hair and skin that glows like the sun itself. Her eyes are pools of light, and her smile is warm and comforting. She is the bringer of light and warmth to the world, and is often associated with fertility and growth. Helia is the patron goddess of farmers and gardeners, and is revered by those who rely on the sun's energy to grow their crops and sustain their livelihoods.

Despite her benevolent nature, Helia is also a goddess of great power and wrath. She is capable of scorching the earth with her heat and unleashing devastating solar flares upon those who would oppose her. Helia's power can be both life-giving and destructive, and mortals approach her with a mixture of reverence and fear.

Helia is often depicted carrying a staff or scepter of gold, from which radiates a brilliant light that illuminates all around her. She is said to have the power to heal the sick and infirm with her touch, and to bless those who seek her guidance with her wisdom.

Those who worship Helia often build temples to her in sunny locations, and offer her gifts of fruits and flowers. They pray to her for bountiful harvests and good health, and ask for her protection from drought and famine. Helia is known to be a goddess who rewards those who live virtuously and work hard, but her wrath can be terrible to those who act with malice or seek to harm the natural world.
