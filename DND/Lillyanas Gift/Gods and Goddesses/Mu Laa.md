Mu Laa is a deity associated with wealth, commerce, and prosperity. He is depicted as a stout, bearded man with a bald head and a perpetual smile on his lips. His eyes twinkle with the light of gold and silver, and his fingers are always jingling with coins.

Mu Laa is said to have been born from the first transaction, when two mortals exchanged goods for the first time. Since then, he has become the patron of all merchants, bankers, and traders, and is revered by those who seek to grow their fortunes.

Despite his association with wealth, Mu Laa is a benevolent deity who believes in fair trade and honest dealings. He is quick to punish those who cheat or swindle others, and his divine wrath can be fearsome to behold.

Mu Laa is often depicted with his faithful companion, a dragon named Hoarder. Hoarder is a creature of great wealth and greed, and is said to have a hoard of treasure so vast that it spans entire mountains. Mu Laa is able to control Hoarder's greed, and uses him to guard the wealth of his followers and punish those who would seek to steal it.

Those who worship Mu Laa often leave offerings of coins at his temples, or pray to him for good luck and prosperity in their business dealings. Mu Laa is known to be a generous god, and will often bestow blessings of wealth and fortune upon those who please him. However, those who cross him will find that Mu Laa's wrath can be just as potent as his blessings.
