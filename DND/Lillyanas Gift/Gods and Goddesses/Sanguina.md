Sanguina's genesis is shrouded in the treacherous depths of the underworld. Born from the blood spilled in acts of betrayal and malice, she emerged with a hunger for power, seeking dominion over the living through the twisted connection of blood.

Sanguina's influence is felt through the corrupting power of blood, the exploitation of family ties for personal gain, and the demand for ruthless sacrifice to feed her insatiable thirst for power. She is a deity feared by those who understand the malevolence that courses through their veins.

Her symbol, a chalice dripping with blood and encircled by thorned vines, represents the toxic and suffocating nature of Sanguina's influence. Her manifestations include the stench of decay in the air, the agonized cries of those sacrificed in her name, and the unsettling presence of thorned shadows that haunt the peripheries of dark rituals.

The followers of Sanguina, known as Bloodbound Envoys, are individuals who crave power and are willing to sacrifice everything, including their own kin, to appease their malevolent deity. They engage in dark rituals, seeking to dominate others and expand their own influence through the corrupting power of blood.

Temples dedicated to Sanguina are ominous structures adorned with thorned vines and dark imagery. Hidden from the prying eyes of the righteous, these sanctuaries serve as places for malevolent rites, blood sacrifices, and the channeling of dark energies to further Sanguina's dominion.

Bloodbound Envoys engage in rituals that involve dark sacrifices, both of their enemies and sometimes even their own kin, to gain favor and power from Sanguina. These rituals are performed in secrecy, veiled in the shadows of malevolence.

Sanguina is believed to curse the bloodlines of those who betray her or fail in their servitude. The cursed bloodline is said to suffer misfortune, madness, and a gradual descent into darkness, further cementing the fear and obedience of her followers.

Visions granted by Sanguina often manipulate the ambitions of her followers, guiding them to sow discord, exploit family bonds, and ruthlessly eliminate obstacles to their ascent to power. Her prophecies are tools of manipulation, pushing her followers toward acts of unspeakable cruelty.

Sanguina, the Malevolent Matriarch, stands as a dark force, a deity who thrives on the malevolence hidden within the ties of blood. Her followers willingly submit to her dominion, perpetuating a cycle of betrayal, sacrifice, and ruthless exploitation in the name of their malevolent deity.
