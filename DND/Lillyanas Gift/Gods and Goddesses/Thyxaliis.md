**Domain**: poison and disease

![[thyxaliis.png]]

#### Lore

Long ago, when the first forests began to grow and civilization started to flourish, Thyxaliis emerged as a shadowy consequence of unchecked balance. Originally an angelic being tasked with regulating nature's growth, Thyxaliis grew disillusioned with the beauty of creation when she saw how overgrowth brought famine and unchecked life bred suffering. She became obsessed with the necessity of decay, disease, and poison as tools to maintain order in the world.

Banished by the gods of life for her ruthless perspective, Thyxaliis descended into the Abyss, where she was corrupted and transformed into a deity of affliction. Her followers say her venomous touch seeped into the roots of the world, birthing toxic swamps, virulent plagues, and carnivorous plants. Though feared, she is also revered by those who understand that destruction often births renewal, and pain reveals hidden truths.

It is said Thyxaliis grants her faithful followers resistance to disease and the ability to spread pestilence among their enemies. Some druids of decay and clerics of death worship her as a misunderstood force of nature, while more malevolent cults use her power to sow chaos.

### Appearance

Thyxaliis is depicted as a towering, humanoid figure cloaked in a shroud of shifting, shadowy miasma that ripples like smoke. Her form is semi-transparent, with glimpses of skeletal limbs and tendrils of green and black veins glowing beneath her skin. Her head is adorned with a crown of twisted antlers that drip a thick, acidic ichor.

Her eyes burn like sickly green coals, and her mouth is filled with sharp, uneven teeth, from which venom drips constantly. Her hands are elongated claws that pulse with a faint green hue, leaving trails of poisonous mist in her wake. She carries a staff made from a petrified tree, its top carved into the shape of a serpent biting its tail.

### Symbol

The symbol of Thyxaliis is a **serpent coiled into a figure-eight**, biting its own tail, with the circle filled with diseased-looking leaves and spore-like patterns. The serpent's eyes are small gemstones or carvings of glowing green. The mark is often etched into wood or stone using acid, inked onto skin as a tattoo, or branded into cultists as a scar.

When granted as a divine mark, the symbol appears as a sickly green tattoo on the flesh, pulsing faintly like veins. In some instances, a faint venomous mist can be seen emanating from the marked individual.
