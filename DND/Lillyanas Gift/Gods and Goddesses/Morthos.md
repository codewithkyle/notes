**Domain**: Death, Fate, Time

In the primordial epochs when the cosmos was but a canvas of chaos and potential, the Eternal Reckoner, Morthos, emerged as a manifestation of the fundamental force that governs all living thingsâ€”death. Morthos is a being of undying existence, a silent observer, and impartial arbiter who guides souls through the intricate tapestry of mortality.

In the celestial expanse, Morthos arose from the cosmic echoes of creation, embodying the inevitability of the passage from life to death. As the stars blinked into existence, Morthos assumed his role, weaving the threads of destiny and overseeing the intricate dance between mortality and the infinite unknown.

Morthos is often represented by a skeletal hand cradling an hourglass, symbolizing the fleeting nature of mortal existence. His presence is felt in the cool breath of the night wind, the rustle of leaves in autumn, and the hushed whispers of fading footsteps.

The faithful of Morthos, known as Reckoners, are somber priests and priestesses who serve as conduits between the living and the dead. They conduct funeral rites, offer prayers for departed souls, and maintain the sanctity of the Veil. The Cult of Morthos believes that death is not an end but a transition, a natural part of the cosmic cycle.

Temples dedicated to Morthos are constructed in locations where the veil between worlds is thin, often near graveyards or within ancient crypts. The interiors are adorned with symbols of mortality, hourglasses, and representations of the cosmic order.

Rituals conducted by the Reckoners involve quiet contemplation, the lighting of candles, and the burning of incense. Symbolic offerings, such as hourglasses filled with sand, are presented to Morthos as tokens of acknowledgment of life's transience.

Followers of Morthos believe in the existence of a grand tapestry that represents the interconnected fates of all living things. Morthos, as the eternal weaver, ensures that every thread, no matter how short or long, contributes to the intricate design of this cosmic tapestry.

The appearance of a skeletal hand or the sound of rattling bones is often considered an omen of Morthos' influence. His prophecies are cryptic and open to interpretation, guiding those who seek insight into the shadowy realms of fate.

In the darkened corridors of existence, Morthos remains an enigma, an ever-watchful deity whose presence is felt in the whispers of the wind and the final breaths of all who walk the mortal path.
