In the annals of divine lore, she is known as the Warforged Deity, an entity whose existence is inseparable from the conflicts and struggles that shape the fate of civilizations.

Lillyana's genesis is shrouded in the forge of battle itself. As countless armies clashed and the cacophony of war echoed through the realms, a surge of raw, unbridled energy coalesced to form the embodiment of conflict—Lillyana. She emerged fully armed, a figure of divine prowess crafted by the tumultuous energies of warfare.

Lillyana's presence is often accompanied by the echoes of clashing weapons, the rallying cries of armies, and the scent of metal and blood on the battlefield. Her manifestations are both awe-inspiring and terrifying, reflecting the harsh realities of war.

Warriors, strategists, and those who seek strength in the crucible of conflict are drawn to Lillyana's divine aura. Her followers, known as the Battleforged, are individuals who view war not as a tragedy but as a transformative force, a means of proving one's mettle and shaping the destiny of nations.

Temples dedicated to Lillyana are constructed in strategic locations, often near battlefields or at the heart of military citadels. These sanctuaries are adorned with weapons, battle standards, and murals depicting the goddess leading armies into glorious victory.

The Battleforged engage in rituals that involve the martial arts, tactical exercises, and symbolic acts of warfare. Offerings of weapons, armor, and tokens from the battlefield are presented to Lillyana as a demonstration of the followers' commitment to the relentless pursuit of victory.

It is believed that Lillyana oversees the Eternal Warfront, a celestial battleground where the spirits of fallen warriors continue their eternal struggle. Those who die in the name of war are said to join this otherworldly conflict, their souls becoming part of the divine tapestry woven by the goddess herself.
