Summoning Oueblek the Eater of Worlds is not a task for the faint of heart. The ritual to call forth this god of destruction requires a significant amount of blood and a great deal of knowledge of ancient and forbidden magic.

To begin the ritual, the summoner must first draw a circle on the ground using royal blood drained from someone who is a chosen warrior of Lillyana or whose ancestors were chosen. Within the circle, they place candles made from the fat of newborn babies, and they light them in a specific pattern.

Next, the summoner must gather a group of willing sacrifices. These can be anyone, as long as their blood is pure and their hearts are full of desperation and desire. The sacrifices must then be bound and placed within the circle, forming a living conduit of energy to channel the summoner's will.

Once the sacrifices are in place, the summoner must recite a series of ancient incantations, invoking the power of Oueblek and beseeching it to answer their call. The words must be spoken with perfect clarity, and the summoner must be careful not to make any mistakes, lest the ritual fail and they suffer the wrath of the god they have invoked.

As the incantations reach their climax, the summoner must then take a dagger made from a rare metal, and draw it across their own flesh, letting their blood flow freely into the circle. The blood serves as a final offering to Oueblek, and as it mingles with the blood of the sacrifices, the worm god begins to stir.

Finally, as the candles flicker and the blood flows, the ground beneath the circle begins to tremble. The summoner must remain focused and maintain their concentration.

As the tremors grow stronger, the summoner knows that the ritual is reaching its climax. With a final cry, they call out the name of Oueblek, and the ground beneath the circle erupts in a shower of dirt and rock. As the last of the summoner continues to bleed out and the last of their live force is drained they achieve euphoria as they see in perfect clarity in their mind's eye the egg of Oueblek sitting within the molten core of the planet.
