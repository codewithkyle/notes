Long ago, when the world was still young and the gods were still experimenting with the creation of life, there was a being that was born from the primordial chaos that existed before time and space. It was a giant worm, wriggling and writhing in the endless void, hungry for something to consume.

In the early days of creation, Oueblek was but a small worm, barely noticeable in the vastness of the cosmos. But as it fed on the primordial energies of the universe, it grew and grew, until it became a monster capable of consuming entire worlds.

The other gods watched in horror as Oueblek's appetite grew, fearing that it would soon devour everything they had created. They debated among themselves on how to stop the worm god, but none could agree on a course of action. They tried to banish it to the farthest reaches of the universe, but it was too powerful to be contained.

They devised a plan to use the worm's hunger to their advantage. It was then that Lillyana, the goddess of war, stepped forward. She had always been a fierce and cunning warrior, unafraid to take risks and make sacrifices to achieve victory. She knew that Oueblek could not be defeated in battle, for its size and power were too great. So instead, she devised a plan to trap the worm god.

Lillyana began by gathering the greatest minds among the gods, enlisting them to help create a weapon of unimaginable power: a black hole. She knew that if she could lure Oueblek into the black hole, it would be trapped forever, unable to consume anything ever again.

But to do this, Lillyana needed to gain Oueblek's trust. She knew that the worm god was not easily fooled, and that it would take a great deal of cunning to trick it into the black hole. So she devised a plan.

They created a planet, rich in life and magic. A planet so rich in divine power the gods knew Oueblek wouldn’t, couldn’t, resist.

Lillyana approached Oueblek, offering it a deal: if it would spare the world it was approaching, she would help it find new worlds to devour. She told Oueblek about a new world that was ripe for devouring. Oueblek, always hungry for more, agreed to the deal, and followed Lillyana to a distant corner of the universe.

When the worm arrived, it burrowed deep into the planet's core, devouring everything in its path. But as it ate, it grew, absorbing the planet's essence and becoming more powerful with each passing moment.

As Oueblek devoured the world Lillyana signaled to the other gods, who activated the black hole. Suddenly, Oueblek found itself trapped, unable to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.

But Oueblek was not defeated yet. It thrashed and writhed, using all of its power to try to break free. It even began to consume the black hole itself, hoping to gain enough power to escape.

But Lillyana was not done yet. She drew upon her own divine power, and used it to seal Oueblek within the black hole forever. Even though Oueblek was gone, the hunger remained. Its essence became infused into the very fabric of the universe, creating pockets of reality where its influence could still be felt.
