### Introduction
> Last time you turned your focus to the mystery of the disappearing travelers and merchants, uncovering unsettling truths. You spoke to a merchant, eyes wary and lips guarded, and then faced Duke Garret Campbell, the powerful and poised ruler of Timberside. His offer was tantalizing: a thousand gold pieces and a wagon with horse to aid in your quest. Yet, your demands for a cart as bait to lure the killer only met resistance. The Duke, ever calculating, insisted the cart in question be the one he already owed you.
> 
> Undeterred, you pressed on, investigating the scene of the attacks. There, amidst the disturbed earth and shattered remnants, you uncovered a chilling revelation—a large, grey-scaled lizard was the true perpetrator of the assaults. Strangely, the tree nearby, believed to be a possible eye witness in connection to the attacks, was okay.

> As the sun begins to rise you all wake. You gather your things and head downstairs when you gather around a table and shell out a few silver for a hardy breakfast of eggs, sausage, and warm fresh baked bread.


### Traveling to Maplemill

![[timberside-maplemill-autumn.png]]

>The journey from Timberside to Maplemill takes you along the forest’s edge, where the mornings greet you with a crisp bite in the air, sharp and invigorating. The sun’s first light dances through the branches, casting golden hues on leaves already beginning to shift from green to brilliant reds and oranges. As the day wears on, the forest seems to breathe with the change of seasons, the wind carrying the scent of earth and damp wood.
>
>By nightfall, the bitter cold creeps into your bones, forcing you to huddle closer to the fire for warmth. The stars hang high and distant in the clear sky, offering little solace as the wind whispers through the trees. Autumn has come, and with it, a quiet foreboding that clings to your every step.

### Approaching Maplemill

>As you approach the city of Maplemill, the dense forest gives way to the shimmering expanse of a vast lake, its waters glinting in the afternoon sun. Ahead, a grand stone bridge arches over the lake’s edge, sturdy and ancient, its surface worn smooth by countless travelers over the years. The city itself sprawls beyond, nestled between the water and the trees, its timber buildings rising proudly against the backdrop of autumn's vibrant colors.
>
>At the end of the bridge stands a massive wooden gate, towering over you, reinforced with iron bands and etched with the marks of Maplemill’s history. The scent of wood and water fills the air as you approach, the steady creak of the gate opening like a herald to the city within. Beyond the gate, the bustle of the city awaits, its streets lined with artisans, merchants, and the rhythmic hum of industry.
