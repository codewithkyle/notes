**Intro**
Shits fucked. As the party regroups, rests, and plans how they'll respond to their current predicament within the comfort of the Squeak Easy. Hollands corpse is being depowered by the hellish creatures lurking within Carn Grave's laboratory and suerly unspeakable horrors are being acted out upon Guy. With no Nordar in sight; Brenmae and Elodin, what do you do now?

**Notes**
- The group fights and kills the monsters.
- Nordar beheads Carn Graves and puts it in his (Brenmae's) bag of holding.
- Nordar puts a bag of holding (robot) within his bag of holding. Just before a rift opens and sucks everything into another plane of existence he sacrifices his gun to pull the head of Carn Graves out.
- The group travels to the Kingmaker's tavern: The Drunken Monkey

**The Offer**
- Map of the castle & dungeon
- Magical weapon permits

Kill Claud Van Doofenwhoozel & 2000 gp

Nordar accepted the deal.
