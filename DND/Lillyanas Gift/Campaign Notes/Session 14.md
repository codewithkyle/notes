On the morning of day two as you all make your way topside you’re greeted with a red sky morning.

### ✅ Hvalfisk

On a successful perception check (DC 15) the lookout notices a whale seems to be following the boat. You noticed it earlier in the day and you didn’t think much of it, you are at sea after all. But now, hours later, it’s still following you? How odd.

If players raise the sails Hvalfisk will catch up. He will attack if attacked. He wants to know:
- Who are you?
- Why are you in his sea?
- What are you doing here?
- Are you fishermen?
- Are you or have you ever been out whaling?

If players are respectful and tell the truth Hvalfisk will ask them if they’re with that other ship as he points generally behind him. If the players look they don’t see another ship.

### ✅ Deadwall Attack

A deadwall ship is sailing through the Black Rose Straight. They’ve snuck past the Blackrock Blockades and they’re looking to terrorize and pillage any unlucky enough to be caught within their sights. They attack after sunset when the storm is at its worst.

**Captain**: Daaro Sorrin
**First Mate**: Thoro Paenelion

Win condition:
- Kill all Deadwall sailors (they will not surrender)

### ✅ Merfolk Attack

- Merfolk Scout and Kelp Eel disable rudder by wrapping the Kelp Eel around the rudder.
- Merfolk stay hidden as air-breathers climb down to pull kelp out of the rudder.
- Merfokl stage a distraction. Several lovely mer surface a few yards away, singing and splashing.
- A few sim near the rudder pretending curiosity.
- Pretend to be enticed by attention from the ship – smiling and waving.
- One of the merfolk holds up a pretty looking shell. They take a deep breath and blow into it. The party hears nothing.
- Spears come flying in from the other side of the ship (surprise attack!)

**Possible win scenarios include:**
Kill the monster before it can sink the ship and all the merfolk will flee, angry and grieved at the death of their pet - they will plot their revenge later!
