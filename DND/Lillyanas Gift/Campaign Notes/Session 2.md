Only a few weapons made of blackrock, lost to time.
Castle made centuries ago.
The Kingmaker - has the bandits gold.

**Introduction**: the players are sitting at a table within the Silver Raven enjoying your breakfast of bacon, eggs, and buttered bread. As y'all are finishing up you notice a man wearing black chain mail enter into the tavern. He looks like one of the city guards except his armour appears to be very well kept and the gold trim has a certain shine to it as if it’s made of actual gold instead of the yellowish paint you’ve become accustomed to seeing on the men who patrol the streets or guard the gates. He stands near the entrance and appears to be scanning the crowd.

**A Presence With the King:**
- He heard you killed a gaggle of gloomstalkers in the Blacktop Hills the other night.
- He’s also heard that you may be the same group of newcomers who arrived from the south a day or two ago.
- Did they come from the jungle?
- The king's son Julian has been kidnapped and he believes they’ve taken him into the jungle.
- The king is sending “that guy” (pointing to the man in black plate mail) but he will need assistance. The jungle is an incredibly dangerous place and guy is the only person in many years who has entered the jungle and somehow survived.
- If the newcomers are as strong as the king believes he needs them to assist the captain.
- He will pay them handsomely.

**Note**: if the party says or thinks Lillyana’s name the symbol will glow in the back of their eyes. If the king sees this he will stumble backward and will be at a loss for words. They have been chosen, they must have been sent to him by Lillyana herself to help him, to protect his family.

**Into The Jungle:**
- After traveling through the jungle for a few hours they are attacked by a Giant Ape.
- After traveling a bit further they stumble upon a cultist camp with 1 Bandit Captain and 6 Bandits. They can discover:
	- The boy is not here.
	- The boy is in an ancient temple deeper in the jungle.
	- They can find the temple by following the river & going through a swamp.
	- The bandits were hired to kidnap the boy and deliver him to the temple.
- They meet a group of 6 Kenku fetching water from the river.
	- The Kenku will not attack unless provoked.
	- If you feed them candy they will follow you.
		- They will not enter the swamp.
		- They chirp and squawk when the players enter the swamp.
- When crossing the swamp 2 Giant Crocodiles attack.
- At the temple players need to get across the broken bridge to enter the temple.
	- The temple appears to have something carved into the stone work. It looks like snakes but it is difficult to tell due to decades of weathering and erosion.
	- If they fall/jump into the water they can locate a small cave entrance behind one of the waterfalls.
	- The door across the bridge requires a riddle. There is a strange text scratched into the arc above the door. There is a panel of buttons with more strange symbols sketched into them. The text reads "I am the beginning of the end, and the end of before." To pass the puzzle the players must press the button for “e”. Pressing the wrong button knocks them into the water below.
- Within the temple there are 2 Cult Fanatic’s and 8 Cultists and Tash.
- The King’s son Julian is being held in the small storage room. He is bound and gagged but does not look hurt or beaten.
