**Introduction**
> The scene opens with the Squeek Easy, a bustling tavern filled with adventurers, merchants, and travelers. Amidst the chatter and clinking of tankards, Brenmae, a familiar face among you, stumbles in, drawing your attention. Something seems off about her demeanor, and as she approaches, you notice a peculiar grey metal collar tightly clasped around her neck.
> 
> Brenmae: Breathless, her voice tinged with urgency. Friends, comrades... I come bearing a burden heavier than any I've known before. She gestures to the collar, a grim reminder of her plight.
> 
> With a trembling hand, Brenmae produces a note, its contents revealing a dire predicament she finds herself in.
> 
> Brenmae: Reading aloud from the note, her voice fraught with tension. "The collar around your neck is filled with fireball spell beads... locked shut with an arcane seal. It harbors a mechanism of dread, one that wields neurotoxins and necrotic poisons. To tamper is to court death's embrace. But there is hope... a path to redemption. The Kingmaker beckons, offering absolution in the guise of a task."
> 
> She pauses, letting the weight of her words sink in, before continuing with a steely resolve.
> 
> Brenmae: "Carn Graves... the architect of our city's suffering. His abode is marked by deceit and treachery, a haven for malice. Our mission is clear: locate, eliminate, and return with his head as a trophy of justice. The debt incurred shall be expunged, and our honor restored."
> 
>  Her gaze sweeps across the assembled adventurers, seeking allies in her quest for retribution.

### Carn Graves Mansion

**Outside**
> Nestled amidst overgrown gardens, the once-grand mansion looms like a silent sentinel, its faded opulence a testament to bygone days of extravagance. Weathered stone pillars flank the imposing entrance, now choked with vines that cling desperately to the facade, as if seeking to preserve a semblance of its former grandeur.
> 
> As you approach, the scent of damp earth and decay fills the air, mingling with the faint echo of laughter and music that once reverberated within these walls. Windows, their panes shattered or obscured by grime, gaze vacantly upon the surrounding wilderness, offering glimpses of the untamed wilderness that encroaches upon the estate.
> 
> The grand double doors, once polished to a gleaming shine, now stand ajar, creaking mournfully on rusted hinges as if beckoning curious souls to venture forth into the forgotten halls beyond.
> 
> Outside, the sprawling grounds lie in disarray, statues and fountains choked with moss and ivy, pathways reclaimed by nature's relentless advance. Yet amid the decay, there lingers a whisper of the mansion's former glory, a testament to the dreams and ambitions of those who once called this place home, now lost to the passage of time.

**Inside**
> Inside, the air is thick with dust, dancing in the shafts of muted sunlight that filter through broken stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns upon the marble floors.
> Faded tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vivid colors muted by time and neglect, while ornate chandeliers dangle precariously from the ceiling, their crystal prisms dulled with age. In the grand foyer, a sweeping staircase ascends majestically, its once-polished banisters now coated in a layer of grime and cobwebs.
> 
> Rooms lie dormant, frozen in time, their furnishings draped in tattered sheets like shrouds concealing secrets long forgotten. Ballrooms echo with the ghostly strains of phantom orchestras, while parlors and libraries stand silent, their shelves laden with volumes untouched by human hands for generations.
