**Introduction**
> The scene opens with the Squeek Easy, a bustling tavern filled with adventurers, merchants, and travelers. Amidst the chatter and clinking of tankards, Brenmae, a familiar face among you, stumbles in, drawing your attention. Something seems off about her demeanor, and as she approaches, you notice a peculiar grey metal collar tightly clasped around her neck.
> 
> Brenmae: Breathless, her voice tinged with urgency. Friends, comrades... I come bearing a burden heavier than any I've known before. She gestures to the collar, a grim reminder of her plight.
> 
> With a trembling hand, Brenmae produces a note, its contents revealing a dire predicament she finds herself in.
> 
> Brenmae: Reading aloud from the note, her voice fraught with tension. "The collar around your neck is filled with fireball spell beads... locked shut with an arcane seal. It harbors a mechanism of dread, one that wields neurotoxins and necrotic poisons. To tamper is to court death's embrace. But there is hope... a path to redemption. The Kingmaker beckons, offering absolution in the guise of a task."
> 
> She pauses, letting the weight of her words sink in, before continuing with a steely resolve.
> 
> Brenmae: "Carn Graves... the architect of our city's suffering. His abode is marked by deceit and treachery, a haven for malice. Our mission is clear: locate, eliminate, and return with his head as a trophy of justice. The debt incurred shall be expunged, and our honor restored."
> 
>  Her gaze sweeps across the assembled adventurers, seeking allies in her quest for retribution.

### Notes

Snuck their way through the city at midnight to the home of Marvin Graves. They searched the house, KO'd the assistant, brutally KO'd the servants, and captured Marvin Graves.

The party got the following information from Marvin:
- His father lives at 444 Wivernely Wane, High Court District
- Marvin isn't sure if his father had anything to do with the attack on the city but he's suspicious
- Koral is the assistant to the Marvin Graves
- Koral has a wife and 2 boys (5y, 6y) who live outside the city
- Koral cannot exit the city because he doesn't have a re-entry permit

Nordar gapped 2 antique daggers, 1 antique sword, and 1 antique shield from Marvin's war room.
