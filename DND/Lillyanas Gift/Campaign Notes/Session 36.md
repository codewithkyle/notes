### Introduction

As the cold wind howls through the craggy peaks of the mountains, you reflect on the journey that has brought you to this point—your path winding through mystery and danger, with every step more perilous than the last.

It all started back on the trail, where you first passed the enigmatic lady in red—with eyes full of secrets. She spoke to you, referring to one of your party members as "Syreo." But was she mistaken? Or did she know something you didn’t? She disappeared as quickly as she arrived, leaving a trail of unanswered questions in her wake.

Soon after, you passed a merchant convoy, seemingly heading toward the bustling town of Maplemill. Their goods and carts clattered on the road, a brief moment of normalcy before the storm that was about to hit.

Your journey then took a darker turn as you made your way to the abandoned monastery, an eerie place filled with shadows of the past. It was there that you were ambushed by a lone assailant—an unassuming man who, after a fierce battle, lay dead at your feet. But before you could fully catch your breath, reinforcements arrived.

The lady in red returned, now revealing her true form, mouth full of sharpened pointed teeth and a fox tail flicking behind her. But she was no longer alone—riding atop a mighty adult black dragon, her power unmistakable. It was then that you realized betrayal had already begun. Max, one of your own, revealed her true allegiance as she almost struck down Brenmae. Elodin had been right—Max was no ally.

In a desperate move, the lady in red invoked a wish, calling forth a mighty spell to revive her fallen comrade. As the tides of battle quickly turned against the party the decision to flee was the only obvious outcome that could offered a chance at survival.

But there was no escape for everyone. Abenthy, Elodin’s Shield Guardian, stood firm and fought valiantly, holding the line as Elodin tended to Brenmae and whisked her to safety. The valiant guardian perished in the battle, sacrificing itself so that the others could escape.

Rocky finding himself alone, desprate to escape as the lady in red and her "pets" began to hunt him down. At that moment the arrival of an ancient and awe-inspiring presence—the golden dragon, Tomidath.  He appeared just in time to protect Rocky.

The lady in red, out matched with the arrival of Tomidath, was not left without words. She and her party vanished, but not before threatening a future encoutner.

Now, as the wind stirs once more, Brenmae, Elodin, and Guy make their way down the mountain pass, heading back to the main road.

Jon finds himself alone several hundred feet down the eastern mountain side and a ways away from the trail.

As for Rocky he is the last remaining party member at the monastery. He is but an ant dwarfed in comparison to the sheer size of Tomidath.

Tomidath had been seeking out the party for the purpose of delivering a command onto them: you are to travel to the White Mountains and retrieve a weapon of immense power, one capable of slaying Lysandra, the shadow serpent—a threat looming over the lands through her Deadwall pawns. 

Rocky what will you do next?

### Rocky and Tomidath

Tomidath gazes down at Rocky, his golden scales gleaming with the weight of millennia, his eyes full of ancient wisdom. His voice, when it comes, is both soft and thunderous, filled with the gravity of one whom has witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations.

>"Ah, young one... your heart is filled with fire, and your blood courses with the power of dragons. But magic... magic is not something to simply be commanded. It is a force of balance, a currency, much like the coins that flow through the hands of mortals. Magic requires an understanding of both its value and its cost."

The air around him shimmering with the weight of his presence as he continues.

>"To harness your innate power, you must first understand that magic is not a thing to be owned. It is something that flows, constantly in motion, like the coins you see in the hands of mortals—ever shifting, never stagnant. You, Rocky, must become attuned to this flow. You must learn to _receive_ and _spend_ the magic within you as carefully as one would spend a single coin from a chest of treasure."

You feels a tingle in your chest as Tomidath’s words resonate with something deep inside you.

>"Close your eyes, young dragon. Feel the energy within you. You were born with the potential to cast spells, but potential is like a gem, uncut and raw. To unlock it, you must focus on the flow of your energy. Reach within and find the heart of your power. Your spellcasting is not just about willpower, it is about _connection_—the connection to the weave of magic that underlies everything in this world, and understanding that it comes at a cost. Magic is wealth, and it is finite. Every spell you cast is like spending a coin—you may find it replenished by your connection to the world around you, but each casting must be deliberate."

He leans down closer, his voice now a low rumble that shakes the ground beneath your feet.

>"When you are ready, you must make a pact with your power, just as I made a pact with the flow of wealth in the world. You will need to understand your own inner balance—when to conserve your magic and when to unleash it. Every dragon is born with this innate connection, but you, Rocky, are more than a mere beast. You are a creature of destiny. And that destiny is bound by how well you can understand the exchange between power and restraint."

Without hesitation or a flinch he plucks a golden scale from his side and hands it to you.

>"Meditate for a moment. Feel the energy flowing through you and when this feeling and intensity reach a tipping point focus on the scale in your hands and try to cast a spell."

Have Rocky roll and arcana check DC 8.

**Success**

>Well done little one. Continue to practice by directing the flow of magic through the scale and, in time, you will be able to cast on command.

**Failure**

>Do not become frustrated with your failure little one. I can sense the magic within you. Perhaps later when you're more relaxed try again.

### Death of (a) Guy

As Guy falls, the world around him fades to darkness. His last breath seems to hang suspended in time, and for a moment, there is nothing but stillness—a void of silence and weightlessness.

Then, suddenly, warmth floods back into your senses.

A gentle crackle of fire greets you. You feel the heat on your face, the faint scent of burning wood filling your nostrils. The space around you is small, cozy, familiar? The walls are modestly decorated, shelves laden with trinkets and knick-knacks. A hearth crackles in the center of the room, casting long shadows across the wooden floor.

Before the fire sits a small boy, perhaps no older than five or six. He’s playing with rough hand carved wooden toys, his hands moving with the innocent focus of a child at play. His hair is tousled, and his clothes are simple but well-worn. The boy’s little brow furrows as he concentrates, unaware of the presence behind him.

Then, as if sensing something, the boy stops. Slowly, he tilts his head upward, his eyes wide with shock.

For a moment, the world seems to freeze—the crackle of the fire, the sound of wind, all become distant and muted. The boy's lips part in disbelief, his voice trembling as he says

>"Dad?"

The word hangs in the air, heavy with meaning. The warmth of the fire, the comfort of this place, the familiarity of the boy’s face—it all feels almost familiar. The figure you sees, so full of innocence, drops his toys as he begins to clamber to his feet.

But before you can respond, before you can even take a step closer to the boy, the world around you begins to unravel. The warmth starts to fade, the flickering light dims, and the image of the boy distorts as if the very fabric of this realm is slipping away from you.

You feel a sharp, almost painful tug pulls at your very essence, like something is yanking you from this world—back to the cold, harsh reality. The boy’s face begins to blur, his voice now a distant echo.

And with that, the warmth, the fire, the boy—everything—vanishes, replaced by the darkness once again.

Suddenly, your filled with an overwhelming sensation of life—of breath, of warmth, of the familiar weight of your body. Your surroundings blur back into focus, and you feel the familiar ground beneath your feet. A coldness returns as you're pulled back into the world, the warmth of that fleeting vision fading into the distant memory.

The spell **Revify** has pulled Guy back from death.
