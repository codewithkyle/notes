### Introduction

As the cold wind howls through the craggy peaks of the mountains, you reflect on the journey that has brought you to this point—your path winding through mystery and danger, with every step more perilous than the last.

It all started back on the trail, where you first passed the enigmatic lady in red—with eyes full of secrets. She spoke to you, referring to one of your party members as "Syreo." But was she mistaken? Or did she know something you didn’t? She disappeared as quickly as she arrived, leaving a trail of unanswered questions in her wake.

Soon after, you passed a merchant convoy, seemingly heading toward the bustling town of Maplemill. Their goods and carts clattered on the road, a brief moment of normalcy before the storm that was about to hit.

Your journey then took a darker turn as you made your way to the abandoned monastery, an eerie place filled with shadows of the past. It was there that you were ambushed by a lone assailant—an unassuming man who, after a fierce battle, lay dead at your feet. But before you could fully catch your breath, reinforcements arrived.

The lady in red returned, now revealing her true form, with a fox tail flicking behind her. But she was no longer alone—riding atop a mighty adult black dragon, her power unmistakable. It was then that you realized betrayal had already begun. Max, one of your own, revealed her true allegiance as she almost struck down Brenmae. Elodin had been right—Max was no ally.

In a desperate move, the lady in red invoked a wish, calling forth a mighty spell to revive her fallen comrade. As the tides of battle quickly turned against the party the decision to flee was the only outcome that offered a chance for survival.

But it was not enough to prevent the arrival of an ancient and awe-inspiring presence—the golden dragon, Tomidath.  He appeared just in time to protect Rocky, as the rest of you quickly fled.

But there was no escape for everyone. Abenthy, Elodin’s Shield Guardian, stood firm and fought valiantly, holding the line as Elodin tended to Brenmae and whisked her to safety. The valiant guardian perished in the battle, sacrificing itself so that the others could survive.

The lady in red, out matched with the arrival of Tomidath, was not left without words. She and her party vanished, but not before threatening vengeance in the future.

Now, as the wind stirs once more, Brenmae, Elodin, and Guy make their way down the mountain pass, heading back to the main road. The fate of the world—and the fate of your party—lies in the task before you: seek out the powerful weapon, defeat Lysandra, and, perhaps, learn more about the mysterious lady in red and her true purpose.

Jon finds himself alone several hundred feet down the eastern mountain side and a ways away from the trail.

As for Rocky he is the last remaining party member at the monastery. He is but an ant dwarfed in comparison to the sheer size of Tomidath. Tomidath delivered a command onto Rocky: you are to travel to the White Mountains and retrieve a weapon of immense power, one capable of slaying Lysandra, the shadow serpent—a threat looming over the lands.

Rocky what will you do next?

### Rocky and Tomidath

Tomidath gazes down at Rocky, his golden scales gleaming with the weight of millennia, his eyes full of ancient wisdom. His voice, when it comes, is both soft and thunderous, filled with the gravity of a god who has witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations.

**Tomidath:**  
>"Ah, young one... your heart is filled with fire, and your blood courses with the power of dragons. But magic... magic is not something to simply be commanded. It is a force of balance, a currency, if you will, much like the coins that flow through the hands of mortals. Magic requires an understanding of both its value and its cost."

The air around him shimmering with the weight of his presence.

**Tomidath continues:**  
>"To harness your innate power, you must first understand that magic is not a thing to be owned. It is something that flows, constantly in motion, like the coins you see in the hands of mortals—ever shifting, never stagnant. You, Rocky, must become attuned to this flow. You must learn to _receive_ and _spend_ the magic within you as carefully as one would spend a single coin from a chest of treasure."

You feels a tingle in your chest as Tomidath’s words resonate with something deep inside you.

>"Close your eyes, young dragon. Feel the energy within you. You were born with the potential to cast spells, but potential is like a gem, uncut and raw. To unlock it, you must focus on the flow of your energy. Reach within and find the heart of your power. Your spellcasting is not just about willpower, it is about _connection_—the connection to the weave of magic that underlies everything in this world, and understanding that it comes at a cost. Magic is wealth, and it is finite. Every spell you cast is like spending a coin—you may find it replenished by your connection to the world around you, but each casting must be deliberate."

He leans down closer, his voice now a low rumble that shakes the ground beneath Rocky’s feet.

>"When you are ready, you must make a pact with your power, just as I made a pact with the flow of wealth in the world. You will need to understand your own inner balance—when to conserve your magic and when to unleash it. Every dragon is born with this innate connection, but you, Rocky, are more than a mere beast. You are a creature of destiny. And that destiny is bound by how well you can understand the exchange between power and restraint."

Tomidath plucks a golden scale from his side and hands it to you.

>"Mediatate for a moment. Feel the energy flowing through you and when this feeling and intensity reach a tipping point focus on the scale in your hands and try to cast a spell."

Have Rocky roll and arcana check DC 8.
