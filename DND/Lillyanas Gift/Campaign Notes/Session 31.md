### Introduction

>The acrid smell of smoke still clings to the air as you rush through the darkened streets, your hearts pounding from the chaos left in your wake. The echoes of the explosion at the magic orb factory reverberate in your minds, but it pales in comparison to what you’ve just accomplished: Claud Van Doofenwhoozel, the tyrant who ruled Deadwall with an iron fist, is dead by your hand. Yet, the weight of your victory is overshadowed by the immediate danger pressing down on you—the city is stirring, the guards already on high alert, and it’s only a matter of time before they discover the ruler's lifeless body.
>
>In the dim light of moon, you slip back to your hidden refuge, The Squeek Easy. There’s no time to savor your victory—every second counts. Inside the familiar walls of the tavern, you work in silence, grabbing only the essentials. The worn leather bags and pouches, filled with supplies and precious belongings, are hastily thrown over shoulders.
>
>Outside, the city of Deadwall feels suffocating, its narrow alleys and towering walls closing in. You can hear the distant shouts of guards, the barking of orders as patrols scramble to respond to the night’s events. Every step you take away from the castle brings with it a growing sense of urgency, as if the city itself is tightening its grip on you. But you don’t stop. Not until you’ve reached the eastern gate.
>
>As you break free from the city, the cool night air greets you like a long-lost friend. The road stretches ahead, dark and uncertain, illuminated only by the pale light of the stars above. The forest looms on either side, shadows twisting in the moonlight, but it's the only path forward. With nothing but the clothes on your backs, the supplies hastily packed, and the knowledge that enemies are surely behind you, you press on.
>
>Deadwall fades into the distance, its towering silhouette vanishing into the night, but the weight of your actions lingers. The road ahead is fraught with danger, but there’s no turning back now.

TL;DR - The party escapes Dimhall under the cover of night and begins traveling SE towards Timberside on their long journey to Freyhorn.

### Traveling through the forest

![[moonlit-path-east-of-dimhall.png]]

>As you venture deeper into the dense forest outside Dimhall, the towering trees seem to close in, their twisted branches forming a canopy that blocks out the moonlight. The only sounds are the crunch of leaves beneath your boots and the distant call of nocturnal creatures, their eyes glinting in the shadows. A cold mist rolls through the underbrush, clinging to your skin like icy fingers, and the scent of damp earth fills the air. The winding path ahead is barely visible, swallowed by the oppressive darkness, but you press on, driven by the need to stay ahead of your pursuers. Every step feels like it could bring danger, yet the deep silence of the forest seems to wait, watching, as if the woods themselves are aware of your presence.
