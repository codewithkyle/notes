**Sensing Lillyanas Gift:**
Everyone has this strange thought bubbling up in the back of their minds. As the sensation grows a name begins to form: Lillyana. As quickly as the feeling formed it begins to fade away yet the name lingers.

Anyone who focuses on the feeling or the name will have a symbol form in their eyes. The strange symbol glows orangish red within the black of their eyes.

**Town Crier:**
A young boy wanders down the city street yelling out:
