### Guys Memories

As Guy's body lies limp strapped to an X shaped rack his first memory was a fleeting vision, a fragment of a happier time that slipped through the haze of pain and confusion like a fleeting star in a storm-ridden night sky.

He was a child again, standing on the sun-dappled banks of a river. The waters sparkled under the midday sun, and a gentle breeze carried the scent of wildflowers and pine from the nearby forest. He could hear the laughter of his friends, the carefree shouts and splashes as they played in the shallows. His father was there, a towering figure of strength and warmth, his deep voice rumbling.

The memory wavered, the brightness dimming as the present bled through. The cool, damp stones of the dungeon wall pressed against Guy's back, the rough iron shackles biting into his wrists. His body ached from the countless bruises and cuts, and the bitter tang of the drugs they forced into him lingered in his mouth.

A shadowy figure loomed over him, the voice of his torturer a sharp contrast to the comforting tones of his father. "Tell us, Guy," the figure demanded, the words dripping with malice. "Tell us about the war plans. Tell us what you know of Fayford's defenses."

Guy's vision blurred, and he struggled to hold onto the fragments of his memory, to the warmth of the sun and the love of his father. He tried to speak, but his voice was a mere whisper, lost in the oppressive darkness of the dungeon.

"Fayford…" he muttered, the word slipping from his lips unbidden. But the rest was locked away, hidden behind a fortress of pain and fog.

Guy's head drooped, his breaths shallow and labored. The dungeon's oppressive air seemed to grow heavier, thick with the scent of mildew and despair. His eyes, half-lidded from the effects of the drugs, barely registered the new presence in the room.

A hooded figure emerged from the shadows, her cloak whispering against the cold stone floor. Her movements were fluid, almost serpentine. As she drew closer, Guy's bleary gaze caught the unnerving sight of a large snake, its scales shimmering as it seemed to blend in and out of the fabric of her cloak. The creature slithered up her body, its eyes glowing with an eerie intelligence.

The figure stopped before Guy, and the snake coiled around her shoulders, hissing softly. She reached out, her gloved hand gripping his chin with surprising strength, forcing him to meet her gaze. Her eyes were cold, devoid of mercy.

"Tell me everything about Lillyana and the other gods and goddesses," she demanded, her voice a silken whisper that carried the threat of pain. "Why is Lillyana interested in you? What purpose do you serve?"

"Lillyana…" he croaked, his voice raspy from disuse and torment. "She… she saw something in me. A spark… a potential."

The hooded figure's grip tightened, the snake's eyes narrowing as if it understood every word. "What potential? Speak, or your suffering will only worsen."

Guy swallowed, his throat dry and raw. He struggled to piece together his fragmented thoughts.

The figure's eyes gleamed with a mix of curiosity and malice. "And what of the other gods? What do you know of their plans?"

Guy shook his head weakly. "I… I don't know. Lillyana never told me."

The figure released his chin, and the snake coiled tighter around her, its tongue flicking out as if tasting the air for lies.
