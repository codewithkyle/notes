Fayford assassin attacks the group on the way back to the ship when they stop to camp for the night.

- After Aukan takes ¼ his HP in dmg he will spawn his two pets.
- If Aukan gets down to ⅛ his HP he will use a dimensional door to escape.
- If Aukan knocks all party members they will be taken away.
	- He is more than willing to kill/let them die – it doesn’t matter to him.
	- He only really wants 1 alive but will accept a TPK.

He is willing to leave his pets if it means he can escape safely.
