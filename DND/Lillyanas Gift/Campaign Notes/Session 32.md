### Introduction

### Traveling through the hills

![[hills-east-of-dimhall.png]]

>The rolling hills stretch out before you, a patchwork of rocky outcrops and wild grasses swaying gently in the wind. The path ahead winds upward, each step revealing a new rise or hidden valley, the sun casting long shadows as it dips toward the horizon. The air is crisp, carrying the scent of pine and fresh earth, but the climb is exhausting, and the distant peaks loom like silent sentinels watching your progress. Every so often, a hawk cries overhead, its silhouette a dark streak against the sky, as if reminding you of how isolated youâ€™ve become. Timberside lies beyond these hills, but each rise feels steeper than the last, and the rugged terrain tests both your endurance and resolve.
