## Traveling in the Air Ship

![[airship.png]]

>As the airship sails high above the landscape, the hum of its arcane engine resonates in your chest, a constant reminder of the magic and ingenuity keeping you aloft. Below, the world unfolds like an artist’s masterpiece. Rolling hills of deep green stretch out, dotted with patches of golden farmland. Tiny villages pepper the landscape, their thatched roofs glinting in the sunlight like scattered gems.
>
>As you approach the Iron Mountains, the terrain begins to shift. The hills give way to jagged peaks of black and grey stone, their craggy faces etched with streaks of rust-red iron. The air grows thinner, sharper, carrying with it the metallic tang of the mountains below. Wisps of cloud curl around the tallest peaks, cloaking them like the beards of ancient giants. The sun casts long shadows, painting the valleys in deep hues of indigo.
>
>The temperature drops as you ascend higher, the chill biting through your cloaks and armor. The wind whistles against the hull of the ship, carrying with it the faint cries of distant mountain birds and the occasional howl of some unseen predator far below. The sight is both humbling and awe-inspiring—a reminder of the vastness of this land and the mysteries it still holds.
>
>Ahead, the peaks begin to part, revealing a path toward The White Mountains. Their snow-capped summits shimmer in the distance, a stark contrast to the iron-dark crags behind you. The arcane compass on the ship's console hums softly, its needle pointing unerringly toward your destination: Stormborough, nestled among the alabaster giants.

## Traveling Up The White Mountains

![[white-mountains-pass.png]]

>The path ahead narrows as the party trudges through the deep drifts of snow, boots crunching loudly in the hush of the upper slopes. Icy winds tug at cloaks and scarves, sending powdery flurries swirling around them and stinging cheeks and eyes. The mountains loom ever larger, their craggy faces glazed white beneath perpetual snowfall, and the air grows thinner with each step. Occasionally, the group glimpses distant forms—perhaps a mountain goat poised on a precarious ledge or a lone raven soaring against the pale expanse—signs of life stubbornly clinging to these frozen heights. As daylight wanes, a subtle warmth in the glacier-gray sky hints that soon they will find the dwarven gate they seek, hidden in the mountain’s quiet guardianship.

## Stormborough

![[stormborough-arch.png]]

>The entrance to Stormborough lies half-hidden in the icy shadows of a towering peak, where the mountain’s pale granite face has been chiseled into solemn dwarven reliefs. Tall, silent statues—each dwarf ancestor bearing a hammer or chisel—flank a broad archway. Moss and lichen cling to the carvings, though the land around is harsh and largely barren, a white tundra broken only by jagged, snowcapped crags. The wind keens through the narrow pass, but here at the threshold to Stormborough’s entrance, there is a hush as though the mountain itself holds its breath, guarding the secret refuge of the dwarves long departed from the world above.

### Entrance

![[stormborough-entrance.png]]

>Before you stands a broad stone archway carved into the icy face of the mountain, flanked by towering statues of grim-faced dwarven ancestors. The land around you is harsh and white, the wind biting against your cheeks as it whips loose snow into swirling patterns.

### The Pipes

![[stormborough-stone-pipes.png]]

>Set into the frame of mountain are a series of hollowed pipes that look oddly out of place against the ancient rock. A quiet hush falls here, as though the mountain itself waits, listening.

**Clue 1: A Fragment of the Past**  
>Chiseled into the pipes is a crumbling inscription in old dwarven script. You recognize certain key phrases that spark a distant, half-forgotten memory embedded in your construction. Phrases like “Iron-born from halls of stone” and “Voices raised against the cold” match the cadence of a lullaby once whispered into your metal ears by your creator. This suggests that the correct tune is not a random melody, but an old dwarven forging hymn.

**Clue 2: The Echoing Hammers**  
>A series of decorative engravings above the pipes depicts scenes from dwarven life: smiths at the forge, miners delving into the mountain’s heart, and families huddled around a hearth. You notice that in each vignette, tiny hammered runes float above the characters’ heads. Translating them, you find each stanza holds a snippet of a repetitive melody—lines that describe metal ringing against metal. These lines align perfectly with the rhythmic hum the bard occasionally hears in his mind, a memory of his creator softly humming while working at the forge.

#### Playing the Melody

DC 24 performance check. 

DC 18 if 1 clue is uncovered.

DC 14 if both clues are uncovered.

**If the Correct Melody Is Played:**  
As the final note resonates, the metal pipes sing back in sweet harmony, their tone echoing deep within the mountain. You feel the ground give a gentle tremor, as if an ancient heart beneath the stone has awakened to this familiar tune. Faint runes along the doorframe begin to glow, illuminating the dwarven carvings with a warm, amber light. With a slow, measured groan, the massive stone doors grind apart, revealing the passage into Stormborough’s hidden halls.

**If the Incorrect Melody Is Played:**  
At the off-key note, the pipes respond with a dissonant clang, their metallic tones clashing sourly against the quiet snowfield. A sudden gust of icy wind howls from the peaks, biting at your ears and making your eyes water. Loose pebbles and ice rattle down the carved surface of the archway, but the doors remain stubbornly sealed. The silence that follows is heavy, as though the mountain’s spirit is disappointed—or perhaps simply expecting more patience and care from those who would enter.

### Alternate Entrances

 #### A Hidden Ventilation Shaft

![[stormborough-ventilation.png]]
 
>Deep drifts of snow have settled against the mountainside, obscuring a narrow crevice that leads into a forgotten ventilation shaft.
 
 With some investigation (and perhaps clearing ice and debris), the party could squeeze through to bypass the main doors. This route might involve navigating cramped tunnels, following faint echoes, and using light sources carefully to avoid getting lost underground.

#### Climbing and Chiseling

The massive statues flanking the door aren’t just decorative; their bases might hide old maintenance hatches or loose stones. With careful climbing, the characters might spot a hairline seam or a concealed latch set high above. By prying a few cleverly placed stones free, they could access an inner mechanism, manually releasing the internal locks without playing the pipes.

### Grand Entrance

![[stormborough-grand-entrance-hall.png]]

>As the massive stone door groans open, the sound echoes into the emptiness beyond. The first thing that strikes you is the stillness—like a held breath, waiting to be released. The hall stretches before you, an enormous cavern carved with the precision and artistry only dwarves could achieve. Towering pillars of intricately chiseled stone line the room, their surfaces etched with faded reliefs of dwarven warriors, grand forges, and mythical beasts. Dust clings to every surface, muting the once-brilliant craftsmanship, and cobwebs hang like forgotten banners in the high arches above.
>
>The air is cool and heavy, carrying the faint scent of earth and stone. Scattered across the floor are the remnants of long-abandoned life—broken tools, toppled benches, and shattered crates, as if the hall had been deserted in haste. The only light comes from the faint glow of lichen clinging to the walls, casting an eerie greenish hue over the space.

![[stormborough-well.png]]

>At the far end of the hall, the floor slopes gently downward into a wide, circular opening—a well-like shaft that plunges into darkness. Its edges are reinforced with stone, engraved with runes of both warning and guidance. Suspended above the well is a massive, ancient mechanism: a complex array of gears, pulleys, and thick, frayed ropes. A rusted metal platform dangles precariously, its chains disappearing into the shadows below. Nearby, a large lever and a hand-crank stand waiting, their surfaces polished smooth by countless years of use, though now they seem untouched by any hand for decades.
>
>The faint sound of rushing water echoes up from the depths of the well, mingled with the occasional groan of the stone under the weight of time. The sense of abandonment is palpable, but so too is the lingering power of the dwarves who once ruled here—a kingdom on the brink of rediscovery, its secrets lying just beyond the veil of darkness.

### Into the Well

>As the machinery roars to life with a reluctant groan, gears grind and chains rattle, echoing through the vast chamber like the growl of some ancient beast. The platform jolts beneath your feet, swaying slightly before it begins its slow, creaking descent into the yawning darkness below. The air grows colder as you descend, carrying with it the damp, earthy scent of stone and moisture.
>
>Above, the faint greenish glow of the lichen fades, swallowed by the shadows, until only the faint light of your torches—or the magic you carry—pushes back the oppressive gloom. The sound of the rushing water grows louder, mingled with the occasional metallic clang as the ancient machinery struggles against time and rust. The walls of the shaft, rough-hewn and glistening with condensation, glide past, narrowing slightly as if the mountain itself is closing in around you.
>
>Every creak of the platform and every groan of the chains sends a shiver down your spine, a reminder of how long it has been since anyone dared to use this passage. The weight of the mountain above presses down, heavy and unyielding, until at last, you catch sight of a faint, flickering light far below—a promise of something waiting in the depths, though whether it is safety or danger remains to be seen.
