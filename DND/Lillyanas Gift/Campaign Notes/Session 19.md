### Stranded Family

- Family stranded on the side of the road. Dead horses.
	- 1 older female (Nileyana Iraninar) and two children (Nilysa and Vargo).
	- A group of men riding in the opposite direction stopped us.
	- Threatened to kill us all if we didn’t give them our horses.
	- Their horses looked exhausted as if they had been ridden hard all through the night and most of the day.
	- I didn’t have a choice. They took my horses. I prayed they would go away.
	- Then they took off to the west. I think they’re going to Dogview.
- The lady looks nervous (insight check).
	- Before they left they drew their swords and cut the throat of the horses.
	- Then they said “stay here and if anyone asks tell them you’ve overheard us riding to Dogview”.

### Military Massacre

- At the split between Raven Cliff and Pondview the party finds a dead platoon. There appears to be about 30 dead soldiers.
- The pools of blood have since soaked into the earth leaving behind a red moist mud.

	- Man: fishing.
	- Woman: washing clothes.

### Shadowpeak

*Nestled within the embrace of the Iron Mountains, the abandoned mining town stands frozen in a perpetual state of desolation. The air hangs heavy with the silence of a community lost to neglect, and the wind whispers through the skeletal remains of buildings like a mournful dirge.*

*Crooked structures, their wooden frames weathered by the relentless passage of nature's hand, loom overhead like spectral sentinels. The cobblestone streets, cracked and uneven, echo with the footsteps of a bygone era, each stone a silent witness to the once-bustling life that pulsed through this god forsaken enclave.*

*Rusted mine carts sit like dormant beasts along the tracks, their wheels immobilized by the weight of time. Abandoned tools lie scattered, forgotten in the midst of labor that has long ceased. As you traverse the desolate streets, the atmosphere is thick with the palpable sense that something otherworldly watches. The mine entrance, now a gaping maw in the mountainside, beckons the curious explorer into the shadows that conceal the secrets within.*

As the party makes their way into the mine:

*The mine tunnels weave through the heart of the Iron Mountains like a labyrinth of forgotten whispers. Walls of cold, damp rock echo with the distant drip of water, and the air is thick with the scent of ancient dust. Shadows dance along the uneven path, revealing glimpses of abandoned mining equipment and the mysterious recesses that beckon the curious to venture deeper into the subterranean unknown. In the distance you can hear hushed wipers and the shuffling of feet.*

As the party approaches the cavern:

*The path opens up into a colossal cavern, its walls lined with gutted veins where precious metals once sat. At the heart of the chamber, a mysterious pale egg, half-buried within the rock, pulsates with an otherworldly glow. The cavern's ceiling disappears into darkness, leaving an eerie sense of vastness.*

*Your attention is drawn to a group of maroon hooded figures who have gathered around the egg in a half circle. Their hushed whispers echo through the cavern as they prepare for a ritual of unknown origin. Sinister symbols are drawn on the cavern floor, and the air is thick with an ominous energy.
As the cultists raise their hands in unison, the pale egg shivers, emitting an ethereal light that casts eerie shadows across the cavern walls. The air is charged with anticipation, and you realize that the secrets hidden within the egg and the fate of the world are about to be unveiled. The silence is broken only by the wail of an upset babe, creating a tense atmosphere as your party stands at the threshold of a potentially perilous encounter.*

*In the center of the half circle stands a hooded figure dressed in black. They gesture and two others approach. One holding a baby, the other a silver chalice. In one smooth instantaneous motion the black hooded figure reveals a dagger and slashes the throat of the baby. As the chanting erupts into a roar they hold the silver chalice up to the gaping throat of the child gathering its blood. The black hooded figure grabs the chalice. They begin spinning their fingers round the rim in a counterclockwise motion while chanting in a foreign tongue.*
