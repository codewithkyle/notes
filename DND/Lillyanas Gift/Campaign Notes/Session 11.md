The party killed the Fire Giant Dreadnought and are heading into the dragon's lair. 

### The King Maker Returns

If the players spend a night at their tavern they will wake up to find a slip of paper pinned to their door frame with a knife. The note contains an address with the name “Kingmaker” signed below.

The Kingmaker is at a old tavern in the roughest part of town. As the part approaches they see someone unconscious get tossed out onto the street landing face first into horse manure.

They are guided upstairs. At the top of the stairs are two tourtles standing guard. Their shells have tribal looking markings etched into them that have been painted red, white, and black. The guards step aside for the party. A nome sees them walking down the hall and quickly scurries to a door. He leans in and then swings the door open guesting for the part to enter.

The Kingmaker is sitting leaning back in a wooden chair at a round table, tea in one hand, rolling dice with the other. A female tiefling and human male are sitting at the table with him. Two more tourtles stand guard within the door on either side of the doorway.

The Kingmaker smiles, waves the others at the table away and invites the party to sit. He tells the party:
- He was going to have you killed for stealing from me
- He heard about your naval battle with the Deadwall fleet and you impressed him
- I had someone tracking you but they lost you at Mr. Nokoborg, did you discover anything interesting?
- Give them an ultimatum: return the item they stole from you OR acknowledge that you are in his debt and that he will collect sometime in the future

If the party attacks he will hop out the window and unless the female tiefling is restrained she will cast a spell and the Kingmaker will vanish before he hits the ground.

### The Chemists Coup

Carn Graves is planning a coup in Dimhall. He is using his wealth to quietly eliminate King Madhar Doxon.

Carn is a successful chemist. During one of his experiments he discovered a crystal chemical that when crushed into a powder and inhaled could keep subjects away for days or weeks at a time. He used the substance himself to stay away during his long hours in his personal lab. He was unaware that the chemical over time would permanently affect his brain, killing parts of it. As the madness set in he grew bitter that the world is owned by strong men.

*The age of brawn has ended, this shall go down in history as the dawn of the intellectual era.*

As a last ditch effort he has concocted a deadly gas and is willing to unleash the toxin upon the populace. The gas is stored in a pressurized cube and is stashed within the high security vault at The New Ageis Bank in Dimhall. No one besides Carn knows about the gas. No one knows it’s in the vault. He bribed the bank's manager Jorrel Cury to allow him and only him undisturbed and unfettered access to the vault.

Carn has also entrusted The Kingmaker with hiring someone capable of eliminating the king.

The gas is blue in appearance and is concocted from unknown sources. He paid a group of cultists residing in the World’s End to provide him with strange plants. There is no cure.

Carn Graves is hidden away in his private underground lab located below his mansion.

He has a Draegloth and Giant Mutated Drow chained up. He thinks of them as pets. They are the horrific results of experiments gone awry.
