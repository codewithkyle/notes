Thaldrin is an enigmatic and eccentric shopkeeper who deals in magical items and rare arcane relics. He speaks in riddles more often than plain speech, making every transaction feel like a puzzle. While his appearance is intimidating, he delights in testing the wit of his customers, sometimes offering discounts or hidden treasures to those clever enough to solve his riddles.

#### Appearance:
Thaldrin is a tall, gaunt elf with pale skin and eyes the color of storm clouds, his long, dark hair streaked with silver. He wears intricate, flowing robes adorned with arcane symbols, the hems of which seem to shimmer with faint magical light when he moves.

#### Bonus description
**For players with Arcana proficiency or passing a DC 16 check**  
There’s a subtle aura of illusion magic around Thaldrin, suggesting that what the players see may not be his true form or he enjoys using illusions to enhance his mysterious nature. Those keen in Arcana may also detect powerful wards around his shop, ensuring no theft goes unnoticed.

#### Wants or Needs
Thaldrin is always searching for rare, powerful artifacts to expand his collection and personal knowledge of magic. He’s willing to offer significant discounts or valuable items in exchange for rumors, leads, or forgotten relics hidden in ancient tombs.

#### Secret or Obstacle
Thaldrin’s curiosity is driven by an old curse—he is bound to collect magical items, never able to stop until he breaks the binding spell. However, the curse ensures that any item of great power he finds will eventually be taken from him unless it’s transferred to another person by their own free will.
