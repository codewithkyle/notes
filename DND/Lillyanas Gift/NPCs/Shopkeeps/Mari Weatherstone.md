Mari runs her store with a no-nonsense attitude, known for her ability to find anything a traveler or townsfolk might need, from dried rations to rare curiosities. She’s been doing this for nearly 30 years, and nothing surprises her anymore—except when someone tries to haggle too much. Beneath her tough exterior, she cares deeply for her community and has been known to help those in need, though she never admits it.

#### Appearance
Mari is a sturdy woman in her late 50s, with silver-streaked hair tied up in a loose bun and faint smile lines etched into her otherwise stern face. She wears simple, practical clothing, always with a leather apron full of pockets stuffed with useful odds and ends.

#### Bonus description
**For players with high Perception, Insight, or passing a DC 14 check**  
Sharp-eyed players may notice that Mari has a faint but well-hidden limp, suggesting she might have seen more action in her youth than just running a shop. Her eyes occasionally dart to a locked drawer behind the counter when certain customers enter, indicating something more valuable or dangerous is kept hidden.

#### Wants or Needs
Mari wants to protect her community, which has been struggling with a recent influx of dangerous travelers. She’s willing to offer discounts or special items to adventurers she believes will help restore peace and order.

#### Secret or Obstacle
Mari is hiding a stash of magical or enchanted items that were once part of her old adventuring gear, but she's reluctant to part with them because they carry both sentimental value and old memories of a life she left behind. She fears these items might draw unwanted attention to her store if the wrong people find out.
