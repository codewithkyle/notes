Varda is a master blacksmith, known for her meticulous craftsmanship and her fiery temper when it comes to shoddy work. She takes great pride in her creations, whether they be simple horseshoes or intricate, enchanted blades. Despite her gruff demeanor, she is fiercely loyal to those she respects and always willing to share her skills—if the price is right or the cause just.

#### Appearance:
Varda is a powerfully built dwarf with broad shoulders, muscular arms, and soot-stained hands that seem permanently marked by the forge. Her dark hair is tied back in a thick braid, and she often wears a heavy leather apron over her sturdy clothes, with a few tools hanging from her belt.

#### Bonus description
**For players with proficiency in Smith’s Tools or passing a DC 14 check**  
A close inspection reveals that many of the tools hanging from Varda’s belt are custom-made, showcasing her own craftsmanship. The hammer she wields has subtle runes etched into its head, suggesting it might hold a minor enchantment or a long history of use.

#### Wants or Needs
Varda is always seeking rare metals or materials to craft even greater works. Lately, she’s been obsessed with finding a mythical ore called "Evershard," rumored to be indestructible and able to hold powerful enchantments.

#### Secret or Obstacle
She believes the location of a hidden vein of Evershard lies deep in the mountains, but her last expedition to find it resulted in disaster, with many of her companions never returning. She hasn’t spoken of it to anyone, but she feels responsible for their fate and is reluctant to try again without help.
