![[Maxine Margaster.png]]

The oldest child in a family of seven, Maxine "Max" Margaster's mother Alice died last solstice under somewhat mysterious circumstances, and her father Duke Darville Margaster, is leading a battalion in the war against Deadwall. 

A precocious kid who found solace in the library of her family's estate. While wandering the library alone (as usual), Max heard a voice calling her through the stacks. Following it led her to a long-neglected corner of the library's cellar, where she discovered a cobweb-covered trunk. The voice compelled her to open it - and within max found the source of the echo in her head: a gleaming-clean great sword the color of black dried blood with a rich black hilt inset with runes she couldn't decipher. Naturally, max picked it up.

The sword, introduced itself as Limbrender, a forgotten death knight, cursed to stalk (well... be carried around) the realm as a sentient blade. Limbrender promised Max great power, the chance to live up to her fathers dreams. With it she could grow strong. She could join her father on the battlefield and he would look at her, for the first time, with a look of pride instead of slumped face of disappointment as he's reminded that his first born was *not* the son he wanted.

Max doesn't know what soul coins are, or what Limbrender (whom he refers to as Lemmy) wants with them, or why she's suddenly unstoppable in single combat and can shake the ground with her fist, but so far she and Lemmy have had a lot of fun. Just don't tell anyone about Lemmy.

#### Appearance
A precocious girl no more than 12, with shaggy blond hair she keeps huffing out of her eyes, dragging an ornate, blood black great sword with a purplish hue that's nearly as long as she is.

##### For the Martially Trained
The sword this girl is carrying looks razor sharp and likely weights more than she does. The fact she can even carry it is a bit of a shock.

##### For Guy
The sword is made of obsidian. No doubt about it.

#### Wants & Needs
Max would very much like to go on an adventure. Any adventure. Perhaps to one of the places she's read about in the library? Maybe to Blackrock? Oo ooo or Mt Nokoborg? Or that alley downtown that leads to the sewers - did you know birds drop dead when they flow through there?

#### Secret or Obstacle
Max is 12, so going places requires approval of the high council or a late night climb out of her bedroom window. She has no idea that she and the sword she carries are now effectively a single undead create - a death knight - but the fact she mumbles to herself in Abyssal is overall not a good sign.

#### Carrying
21sp, 15gp, 12pp; a short list of adventure locations she wants to explore; a rudimentary map of the realm and all its capital cities; a set of flash cards detailing deities and their known domains; a device she inhales through she she gets too excited.
