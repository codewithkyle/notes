**Location:** ??

![[Garret Campbell.png]]

The urban center and local land is currently the property of Duke Garret Campbell - a royal third cousin (twice removed), who serves as its warden. Recently, a series of attacks on merchants and other travelers has grounded the realm's supply chain to a halt. The Duke seeks willing adventurers to locate and eradicate the problem, and will pay them handsomely - particularly if they tell any nobles they meet that fixing the supply chain was the duke's idea.

#### Appearance
A rail thin, hunched-over man of indiscernible age wearing a dingy brown doublet and a dark leather skull cap.

##### For the Perceptive
The duke's boots look at though they were recently cleaned, but there appears to be traces of mud.

#### Wants & Needs
The duke wants able-bodied adventurers to locate and eradicate the source of what has been plaguing merchants who travel through the area on their way to major port cities.

#### Secret or Obstacle
The Duke has purposefully allowed the problem to grow out of hand, going so far as to temp more of the creatures closer to the road with the bodies of freshly killed criminals - so that he can receive a better title (and the lands that come with it) as a reward for resolving the issue.

#### Carrying
80gp; 15pp; 330gp in dark onyx gemstones; a signet ring worth 130gp; a walking cane topped with a silver toad.
