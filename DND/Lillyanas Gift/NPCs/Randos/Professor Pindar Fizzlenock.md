#### Appearance

Professor Pindar Fizzlenock is a small, elderly gnome with a wild shock of white hair that sticks out in all directions, as if perpetually charged with static. His round spectacles are always perched on the very edge of his nose, constantly sliding down his face and making him look like he’s on the verge of losing them. He wears a patchwork robe covered in various stains, some from his experiments, others from his love of cooking. His shoes, mismatched and a bit too large for his feet, have bells that jingle as he moves. A large, slightly crumpled leather apron, dotted with various pockets filled with oddities, is tied around his waist.

He has a perpetual twinkle in his eye, as if he's in on some joke that no one else understands, and his hands are always busy with something—twiddling a tiny spoon, scribbling notes, or adjusting one of the countless vials and bottles that line his cluttered workbench. His beard is bushy and unkempt, but there’s a glimmer of pride in how it somehow always manages to stay clean despite the chaos of his workspace.

#### Personality

Professor Fizzlenock is a gnome with more enthusiasm than sense. His mind races at a thousand miles per minute, jumping from one thought to another with little warning. He’s constantly in motion, muttering to himself and sometimes forgetting what he was saying mid-sentence. But his scatterbrained nature hides a deep well of knowledge, particularly when it comes to potions and concoctions. He's always eager to help those in need—though his solutions often come with a side of eccentricity. He might hand you a potion for invisibility, but it could turn out to make you glow bright pink instead.

Despite his oddness, he’s incredibly well-meaning and has a deep passion for both potion-making and food. In fact, he sometimes gets so distracted by the art of cooking that he ends up boiling up strange brews for meals instead of for potions. He treats everything like an experiment, much to the concern of his friends and those who seek his help. He tends to give lengthy, convoluted explanations that don’t really help much, though they’re peppered with bursts of genuine insight.

#### Backstory

Fizzlenock has lived alone atop Mt. Nokoborg for many years, originally traveling there in search of the rare volcanic herbs that grow near the dormant volcano. What started as a scientific expedition became a solitary life spent experimenting with the mountain’s strange flora and fauna. He’s crafted countless potions over the years, many of them useful, others a bit... unpredictable. The mountain's isolation suits him just fine—he loves the peace and quiet, though he secretly wishes for a little more company.

Fizzlenock was present during the party's initial encounter with Tomidath, and though he doesn't remember much about the specifics (as he was likely distracted by a batch of experimental stew), he was deeply impressed by their bravery and tenacity. His potions, while generally safe, may have a few "extra ingredients" that reflect his whimsical nature.

#### Wares

**Potion of Colorful Confusion**
**Price:** 500 gp  
**Effect:**  
Upon drinking this potion, the consumer's vision becomes a riot of flashing, shifting colors. For 1d4 hours, everything the drinker sees is distorted, as if through a kaleidoscope. While this effect is in place, the drinker has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack rolls. However, the confusion is harmless and offers a brief respite from the mundane.  

>"Oh, it’s a brilliant little thing, isn’t it? Can’t help but bring a smile to your face! You see, it makes everything look so much more... _interesting_! Colors swirling, patterns shifting! You might not see your enemies clearly, but at least you’ll see the world in a whole new light!"

**Fizzlenock’s Infernal Hot Sauce**
**Price:** 750 gp  
**Effect:**  
This thick, fiery red concoction tastes like it was forged in the very heart of a volcano. Upon consumption, the drinker gains resistance to fire damage for 1 hour. However, they also feel an intense, burning heat in their stomach, causing disadvantage on Constitution saving throws for the duration of the potion’s effect.

>"Ah, this one! A masterpiece, really. I tried making a sauce to complement my stew once, and well... let’s just say it got a little out of hand. But it’s _perfect_ for those looking to survive in the heat of battle—or the heat of my kitchen, if you’re brave enough!"

**Potion of Temporary Teleportation (Sort Of)**
**Price:** 1200 gp  
**Effect:** 
When consumed, the drinker briefly disappears, only to reappear 10 feet in a random direction. The teleportation is uncontrollable and unpredictable, so it can land the user in an awkward, potentially dangerous position. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, during which the user may appear to teleport randomly around the battlefield. This potion is often used to confuse foes or escape danger, though it may not always have the desired effect.  

>"A little trick I’ve been working on! You see, it’s a bit like teleportation, but... not exactly. It’s more of a ‘suggestion,’ you know? You pop in, you pop out, and suddenly you’re somewhere new! Could be great for escaping a tight spot—or making a fool of your enemies! But don’t ask me why it only ever goes 10 feet—science doesn’t always explain itself."

**Potion of Invulnerability**
**Price:** 3800gp
**Effect:**
For 1 minute after you drink this potion, you have resistance to all damage. The potion's syrupy liquid looks like liquefied iron.

---

**Potion of Longevity**
**Price:** 9000gp
**Effect:**
When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a _potion of longevity_, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
