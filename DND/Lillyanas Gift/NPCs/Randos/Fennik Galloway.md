**Occupation:** Merchant

![[fennik-galloway.png]]

Fennik is a smooth-talking merchant who roams between towns and villages, selling rare trinkets, oddities, and sometimes questionable "magical" items. Though charming, there's a hint of desperation behind his easy smile, as if he's always running from something. He never stays in one place too long, making his living off the thrill of constant motion.

#### Appearance
Fennik is a wiry man in his early 40s with weathered, sun-beaten skin and sharp, darting eyes that seem to catalog everything they see. His clothes are practical but ragged, save for an embroidered red scarf he wears, a relic from better times.

#### Bonus description 
**For players with high Perception, or Insight DC 15:** 
There’s a faint twitch in his left hand when he speaks of his travels, betraying a nervous energy he’s otherwise skilled at hiding. Sharp-eyed players might notice that the red scarf looks more like a trophy than a cherished possession, with initials stitched into it that don't match his own.

#### Wants or Needs:
Fennik desperately seeks a place to hide or a way to disappear, as he's being hunted by a mysterious figure for a deal gone wrong. He wants to unload a certain "cursed" item he unknowingly took possession of, and he's hoping to pass it on to someone unsuspecting before his pursuer catches up.

#### Secret or Obstacle:
The item Fennik is carrying is bound to his life force—if someone else takes it, his curse transfers to them, but he won't mention that part. The person hunting him is no ordinary foe, but a powerful mage who placed the curse on Fennik as part of a dangerous game.

#### Carrying
- A cursed, gem-encrusted amulet (binding the curse to Fennik)
- A deck of strange, faded cards (Harmless at first glance, but holding forgotten power)
- 55cp; 24sp; 15gp;
- A vial of “nightshade” (either poison or placebo, Fennik won’t say)
- A frayed map of trade routes with some curious, unknown landmarks
