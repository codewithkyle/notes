An exceptionally thin human man, whos' gaunt features are exacerbated by his above-average height, Duffy McGill ("Tall Duffy" to all who know him and many who don't) is soft spoken but sturdy in demeanor and used to hunching down a bit to look folks in the eye. Which he always dose. Perhaps for too long.

#### Appearance
A man who looks to be in his mid-40s with thinning brown hair; very thin and extremely tall, with a steady gaze and a flat smile.

##### For the Perceptive
Tall Duffy's pant legs seem sewn from a different type of fabric starting just below the knee.

#### Wants & Needs
Tall Duffy has but one dream: ride a horse tall enough to accommodate his height.

#### Secret or Obstacle
In his dreams, the horse is actually a centaur, taking him far from this city, never to return.

#### Carrying
51cp, 4sp; a single gold piece; a book of poetry about centaurs.
