A gossip-trader with a gift for gab, Sedona Myth knows a little something about nearly everyone in the part of the city she calls home. She has a lovely family, a habit of making boring stories more scandalous and a price on her head - a consequence of an embellished tale about Janeen Montclair that made its way to Janeen's father Kart, a powerful merchant with deep pockets and a strong sense of honor.

#### Appearance
A blonde-haired woman of middle age, with almond-shaped eyes, gapped teeth and a voice louder than it needs to be.

##### For the Perceptive
Sedona seems to prefer shifting the conversation to other people's troubles than talk about her own woes - which are considerable.

#### Wants & Needs
Protection. At least until she can sort things out with Janeen, who's definitely cheating on her husband... with... an orc! Can you believe it?!?

#### Secret or Obstacle
Sedona can't shop herself from spreading stores about folks in town and has very few true friends (if you can believe it).

#### Carrying
13cp, 18sp; a hairpin sharp enough to function as a dagger; a rudimentary disguise kit consisting of a scarf, sunglasses, and an oversized sun hat.
