By far the most polite and bubbly city patrol person around, Kardina Mintleaf has such a joyful enthusiasm for her job you'd probably guess she catches butterflies for a living rather than criminals. Even when she shackles particularly aggressive types, Kardina maintains her sunny disposition as she uses her shocking strength and understanding of body leverage to muscle much larger men to the ground.

#### Appearance
A petite woman with wide green eyes and a big ball of curly gray hair, her crooked smile looks like a lightning bolt.

##### For the Insightful
This might be the most positive person any of you have ever met. It's a little unnerving.

#### Wants & Needs
Kardina is pushing for legislation requiring all the city watch to smile and stay upbeat while on duty.

#### Secret or Obstacle
Each night, when she's all alone, Kardina plays her flute and drinks fermented licorice tea until she passes out, in an effort to forget the man who tormented her in another life.

#### Carrying
8cp, 11sp, 11gp; a brass flute she uses as a billy club or signal for backup.
