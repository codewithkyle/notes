**Location:** [[Timberside]]

## Introduction

### Duke Garret Campbell

Character reference: [[Garret Campbell]]

>A rail thin, hunched-over man of indiscernible age wearing a dingy brown doublet and a dark leather skull cap. His face a mask of concern. As the party approaches, he straightens his posture and gives a solemn nod. Before saying *"Ah, welcome travelers. I'm glad you've arrived safely. Welcome to Timberside. If I may have a moment... How did you make it into the town?"*

If the party engages:

> I fear something dark is at work here, something beyond the ordinary. The attacks on travelers and merchants are becoming more frequent and more vicious. I need someone who can investigate these incidents, track down this menace, and put an end to the suffering.

If the party continues to engage:

>I’ll reward you handsomely for your efforts—both in coin and favor.

### The Timbered Tankard

Character reference: [[Sedona Myth]]

>As the party enters the bustling tavern, the warm glow of the hearth and the hum of conversation fill the air. Locals chat animatedly, their voices blending with the clinking of mugs and the occasional burst of laughter.
>
>A blonde-haired woman of middle age, with almond-shaped eyes, gapped teeth and a voice louder than it needs to be sets down several drinks at a nearby table before turning to address the party *"Welcome to the Timbered Tankard! What can I get you? We’ve got ale, stew, and a warm fire. Or perhaps you’re here for some local gossip? We’ve had plenty of that lately.*

When the party engages with the gossip:

>*"Well I tell ya about Janeen who from what I hear has been cheating on her husband with..."* she pauses for a moment to look around before continuing *"an orc! would you believe that?!?"*

Other people the party could talk to:

**Liam Corwin - Local Merchant**

>Aye, it’s been a rough patch. I'm afraid to travel out of this damn city because of these damn bandits.

In the party pushes him about the problem being bandits:

>I heard a few folks talk about seeing someone friendly-looking who vanished right before an attack. Seems obvious to me that's the problem.

**Traveler**

>I saw one of those... attackers, I think. Seemed like a normal person at first, but something didn’t sit right. I didn’t stick around to find out more.

**Bard**

>There’s also talk that the Duke’s been all too eager to deal with these attacks. Seems like he’s got something to gain from all this chaos.

## Investigating The Scene

>As the party approaches the site of the latest attack, they find themselves at the edge of a dense forest, where the underbrush has been trampled and scattered. The ground is littered with debris: broken crates, torn fabric, and scattered personal belongings. The area is eerily silent, with no signs of life except for the occasional chirp of a distant bird.
>
>The remnants of a recent struggle are apparent, with bloodstains smeared across the ground and a few hastily discarded items of clothing. The surrounding trees are scarred and bent, as if something heavy or violent had crashed through them.

Let the party engage

**Upon closer inspection, the party uncovers several unusual details:**

- **Claw Marks:** Among the bloodstains and debris, they find distinct claw marks on the ground and on some of the nearby trees. These marks are irregular and appear to have been made by something with both sharp claws and considerable strength.
    
- **Disturbances in the Soil:** The ground around the scene shows signs of violent upheaval. There are patches where the soil seems to have been disturbed in an unnatural way, with large gouges and areas where the earth seems to have been scorched or melted.
    
- **Unusual Slashes:** The torn fabric and broken crates have strange, jagged slashes on them that don’t match typical weapon marks. These slashes seem to be more akin to the swipe of a large, powerful creature.
    
- **Abrupt Footprints:** The party finds footprints that start and end abruptly, as if the attacker could have appeared or vanished suddenly. These tracks are larger and more distorted than typical humanoid footprints, hinting at the possibility of transformation or a non-standard form of locomotion.

## Investigation of the Duke

If the party meets with the Duke:

>I’ve heard rumors that the creature has been sighted near the northern woods. If I were you, I’d start your investigation there. Be cautious, though; it’s dangerous territory.

If the party insight checks the Duke:

- **Defensiveness:** If pressed about details of the attacks or specifics on how he’s been managing the situation, the Duke might become evasive or defensive. His answers could seem rehearsed or overly vague.
    
- **Avoidance of Details:** The Duke may avoid discussing recent crime reports or where the bodies of criminals have been discarded, instead focusing on the general safety measures he’s implemented.

If the party investigates the Duke's home or office:

>You come across a large wooden desk cluttered with papers and ledgers. Among the documents, they find a particular ledger that appears to be less frequently accessed. The cover is worn, and it has a label that reads "Mortuary Records and Dispositions."

If the party investigates the ledger:

>Upon opening the ledger, they see a series of entries detailing recent deaths and disappearances. Most of the entries are brief and matter-of-fact, noting the name of the deceased, the date, and the cause of death. However, as they skim through the pages, they begin to notice an alarming pattern:

- **Unusual Frequency:** The ledger shows a significantly higher number of deaths in recent months compared to previous periods. There are numerous entries marked with vague descriptions like "Unknown Cause" or "Unspecified."
- **Discrepancies in Dates:** Some of the entries are dated within a narrow timeframe, indicating several deaths occurring on the same days or in close succession. These dates don’t align with the Duke’s public statements about the attack timeline.
- **High-Profile Cases:** The ledger includes several entries for individuals who were known to be well-connected or influential, yet their deaths are handled with minimal documentation or detail. This stands in contrast to the more thorough records for less prominent individuals.
- **Frequent Disposal:** There are several notes indicating the expedited disposal of bodies. Some entries mention "Urgent" or "Priority" status for the handling of these bodies, suggesting an unusual level of urgency or importance in their processing.

If the party rolls high:

As the party examines these discrepancies, they also find an additional note tucked into the back of the ledger. It’s a hastily scrawled memo:

>“Ensure swift processing of all recent arrivals. Increased scrutiny expected. Avoid unnecessary attention.”

## The Merchant

> As you wander through the bustling market square, they come across a stall that seems somewhat out of place. The merchant, a middle-aged man with a friendly demeanor and an air of practiced charm, stands behind a table cluttered with a bizarre assortment of items.
> 
> On one side of the table, there are neatly arranged pots of herbs and vials of colorful liquids, each labeled with names like “Healing Salve” and “Elixir of Vitality.” They appear to be standard adventurer’s supplies.
> 
> Opposite these, the merchant displays an assortment of strange, exotic trinkets—tattered maps, jagged shards of metal, and eerie-looking amulets. One item is a small, crudely carved idol with unsettling, unnatural features.
> 
> Mixed in with these are several well-worn weapons and armor pieces, some of which look like they’ve seen better days. The craftsmanship is inconsistent, with some items appearing of high quality while others are poorly made or damaged.

If they haven't met him:

>Greetings, travelers! Looking for something special? I’ve got a little bit of everything here—potions for your health, artifacts for your collection, and equipment for your adventures. You won’t find a selection like this anywhere else.

If they have met him:

>Hello again, travelers! Looking for something special? I’ve got a little bit of everything here—potions for your health, artifacts for your collection, and equipment for your adventures. You won’t find a selection like this anywhere else.

If the party engages:

>Do let me know if anything catches your eye. I’ve got just the thing for every need… or perhaps something you didn’t know you needed.

Investigation check

>As you examines the stall, you notice that the items are not only eclectic but also seem strangely mismatched. Some of the healing potion bottles vary in volume, some in subtle ways, others not so much.

If they push him about his wares he won't give anything up unless they loosen his lips with a bit of coin.

If the party has been to the latest attack site he'll tell them about another one further down the road leading out of town.

If the party has not been to the attack site he'll tell them about it.

Either way the merchant will show them the way, for a bit of coin. Time are tough since he can't travel.

## The Trap

>Liam Corwin quickly breaks down his stall and begins to guide the party out of town to the site of a recent attack.
>
>As the party follows, Liam gestures grandly towards the path ahead.
>
>*“Ah, you’re in for a treat! The site of the attack is not far from here. We’ll take a well-trodden path that should make the journey swift and straightforward. Follow me closely, and you’ll get a firsthand look at the scene.”*
>
>The merchant strides confidently, his pace brisk and purposeful. The path quickly leads them away from the well-traveled roads of Timberside and into a dense, shadowy forest. The trees close in around them, and the once-familiar sounds of the town fade into a distant murmur.

A few minutes later:

>*“Not much farther now. The area up ahead is where I found it.”*
>
>As you move deeper into the forest, the surroundings grow increasingly eerie. The forest floor is uneven, with twisted roots and underbrush that seems to whisper in the wind. The merchant’s demeanor remains upbeat.
>
>*"Watch your step; the ground can be tricky. It’s easy to get disoriented out here if you’re not careful."*

A few more minutes later:

>*“Ah, yes, this is the area I was telling you about. Look around and see if you can spot any clues. I’ll just keep an eye out for any signs of trouble... though, given the nature of these attacks I'm sure you'll find plenty once you've located the beast that has caused all this trouble.”*
>
>As you arrives at the attack site, you find yourselves in a clearing surrounded by dense forest. The ground is littered with debris: broken crates, torn fabric, and scattered personal belongings. Bloodstains smear the ground and splatter against nearby trees, marking the scene of a violent struggle.
>
>The remnants of a cart or wagon can be seen overturned, its contents strewn about in disarray. The surrounding trees are scarred with deep gouges, as if something large and powerful had crashed through them. The area feels heavy with an unsettling silence, broken only by the distant chirping of birds and the rustle of leaves.

>As you all turn around you see the merchant’s form beginning to shift and distort. His human guise melts away, revealing the grotesque, toad-like visage.
>
>The creature lets out a guttural laugh, its voice now deep and unsettling.
>
>*“You were too trusting, adventurers. Did you really think a creature like me would be so easy to find? Welcome to my domain. It’s time to see if you’re as clever as you think.”*
