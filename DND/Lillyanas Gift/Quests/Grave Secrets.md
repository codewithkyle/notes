> The cemetery sits on a quiet hill overlooking the lake, the sound of gently lapping water mixing with the soft rustling of autumn leaves. Rows of headstones stand solemnly beneath the vibrant canopy of trees, their leaves now a deep red and orange, fluttering down like embers from a dying fire. A cold breeze cuts through the gathering as the people of Maplemill cluster around the freshly dug grave, their breath misting in the crisp autumn air.

> At the center of the crowd stands a young blond haired girl in a purple cloak, her expression stoic but her eyes betraying a deep, unspoken grief. Before her rests the body draped in the crest of House Margaster. The priest’s voice rises over the crowd, offering words of solace, though they feel distant against the weight of suspicion lingering in the air. As the final rites are read, the clouds overhead darken, casting long shadows across the grave, as if even the skies themselves mourn this loss.

>As the priest speaks, your eyes catch a flicker of movement near the treeline, where a small group lingers just beyond the mourners, half-hidden in the shadow of the swaying branches. Their hoods are drawn low, faces obscured, but you notice their focus is not on the ceremony—it’s on the girl. One figure leans toward another, whispering something as their gaze narrows, then quickly shifts away when they realize they've been noticed.

### Confrontation

If the party chooses to confront the group, the figures will try to flee once they’re approached, leading to a tense chase through the city’s streets or forest outskirts. If the party catches them, they can interrogate one of the group members. Depending on how the party handles the situation, the mercenary might reveal:

They were hired to keep an eye on Maxine and report back to someone in the city.

### Shadowing the Group

If the party decides to be more discreet and follow the group from a distance, the figures will eventually lead them to a hidden location—a run-down tavern, a shady warehouse, or a secluded spot in the woods. This could reveal:

- The group is meeting with a local figure of power: [[Baron Kessler]]
- There’s an exchange of information, and the players overhear mentions of Ronnie’s investigation.

### Baron's Motivation

Kessler is targeting Maxine as a way to get to Duke Darville. If he can harm or capture Maxine, he knows it would force the Duke’s hand, potentially drawing him away from the war effort and destabilizing Maplemill’s military leadership. The loss of a loved one, especially in the form of a kidnapping or assassination attempt, would deeply wound the Duke and distract him from his duties on the frontlines, weakening the city’s defenses and allowing Kessler to strengthen his position.
