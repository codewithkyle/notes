>As you move deeper into the forest, figures begin to emerge from the shadows—tall, with skin that looks like rough bark. Their eyes, deep-set and dark, seem to carry an ancient sadness. They don’t speak, but they watch you closely, their heads tilting slightly as if they understand more than they show.

**If the party choose to observe:**

>Without a word, they raise their arms in slow, deliberate motions, beckoning you to follow. Their movements are graceful but heavy, like they’re carrying the weight of centuries. They turn silently, guiding you deeper into the woods.

**If the party chooses to follow:**

>As you follow the silent forest folk, the trees grow older and denser, their twisted branches blocking most of the light. Soon, they stop and gesture toward a massive tree ahead. It stands like a sentinel, towering above you with ancient, gnarled roots gripping the earth. A foul stench fills the air but only for a moment.
>
>As you approach, a foul stench fills the air. A stench so tick you can taste it. Rounding the base of the tree, you see it—a dark, gaping hole. The bark around it is blackened, oozing sap like blood, and the smell of decay is overwhelming.

**Player interaction**

>As you peer into the dark hole at the base of the tree, the foul stench of decay intensifies. The hollow seems to twist downward, beyond the roots and deep into the earth. The inside walls are slick with oozing sap and black rot, and you can just make out a rough, narrow tunnel leading into the darkness below.

**If the party chooses to enter:**

>The deeper it goes, the more unnatural it feels. The roots above twist and writhe, as if recoiling from whatever lies beneath. A faint draft wafts up from the depths, carrying with it a cold, damp air—and something else. Something... wrong.

## The Cave

>The tunnel finally opens into a cavern, the air here thick with damp and rot. The ground is uneven, slick with mud and twisted roots that seem to twitch ever so slightly underfoot. The walls, lined with dark, pulsating growths, pulse with a sickly light, casting eerie shadows.
>
>At the center of the chamber, half-buried in the earth, lies a grotesque mass—a heart-like object, blackened and rotten, tendrils spreading out from it like veins. It throbs faintly, as though alive, and the stench is overpowering. Whatever this thing is, it’s the source of the corruption. The darkness feels... alive, almost as if it’s watching you.

### Investigating the room

**Goal:** players should investigate the room to discover the symbols carved into different rocks  around the edges of the cave.

>As you explore the cavern you discover 5 large rocks around the cave each with their own runic symbol carved into them. As you continue to search your eyes catch an ancient mural etched into the wall. It depicts five figures standing in a circle around a heart. Each figure reaches out toward a symbol. 
>
>Beneath the mural, there's an inscription in an old, barely legible script.

**DC check to read the script**

>From what you're able to make out it seems to read *“By our blood, the heart shall mend. Follow the rhythm, let the cycle end.”*

### Investigating the heart-like object

>As you approach you notice the heart-like object has runic symbols etched into it. As you watch, the symbols on the seem to glow faintly in a pulsing pattern.

## Blood Puzzle

- **Visual Clues**: The mural shows figures (representing the players) interacting with the symbols with their hands to the runes. The heart-like object and dim red pulsing light indicate blood.
- **Textual Clues**: The inscription hints at using blood ("By our blood") and following the sequence ("Follow the rhythm") indicated by the pulsing symbols.
- **Connection to Puzzle**: The pulsing glow emphasizes the order in which the symbols should be activated.

### Failure

>As you touch the runes, the heart-like object reacts violently. Its dim red glow intensifies to a blinding crimson light. Suddenly, dark tendrils of energy erupt from the heart, lashing out in all directions. Each of you feels a cold, searing pain as the shadowy force strikes, draining warmth and vitality from your bodies. The cavern reverberates with a deep, unsettling hum, and the very air feels heavy with malice. The heart pulses erratically, the red light flickering as the shadows recede back into it, leaving behind an eerie silence.

**DC 22 con save:** everyone takes 2d8 + 4 necrotic damage. Half as much on a save.

### Success

>As you complete the sequence, each of you dripping a bit of your blood onto the runic symbols in the precise order of the heart's pulsing light, a profound silence falls over the cavern. The dim red glow of the heart intensifies, the pulses quickening like a racing heartbeat. The runes on the surrounding rocks ignite, connected by thin veins of luminous energy that converge on the heart-like object.
>
>For a moment, everything is still. Then, with a sound like cracking wood and tearing flesh, the heart splits open. A surge of dark energy bursts forth, swirling upward like a shadowy vortex. The air grows cold, and the stench of decay is replaced by an even more oppressive aura.
>
>The shadows coalesce, forming into a shape that was once imprisoned within the heart. The very ground beneath you trembles as the presence manifests fully. The cavern's walls seem to close in, the dim light swallowed by the encroaching darkness emanating from the entity now before you.
>
>Before sits a pile of dissolved bones, seemingly eaten way by acid, encircled in a mound of quivering, pus-covered flesh.
>
>An otherworldly sound echoes through the chamber—a chilling mix of a whisper and a roar—signaling that the seal has been broken. The creature is free, and the weight of its evil presses upon you. The final trial stands before you, born from the heart of the rot you sought to cleanse.
