### Introduction 

>You feel the deck tilt under your feet, a subtle shift at first that quickly worsens into a noticeable lean. A chorus of strained creaking comes from the timbers and rigging above, as if the ship itself is groaning in protest. The gentle hum of the engines, normally a soothing backdrop, now stutters and sputters like an unsteady heartbeat. With each uneven jolt, loose items slide and clatter across the planks, and the faint odor of hot metal and singed ozone reaches your nostrils. It’s clear something has gone terribly wrong with the vessel’s core mechanisms. As you gaze over the railing to the earth below it is apparent that you are beginning to lose altitude and if you don’t intervene soon, this flight may come to an abrupt and violent end.

Start a 20 minute timer.

### The Engine Room

![[airship-engine.png]]

>You step into a cramped chamber bathed in shifting, prismatic light. At its center hovers a large, spherical crystal—its surface crackling with faint arcs of arcane energy. A metal framework of interlocking rings and curved arms surrounds it, suspended in midair by intricate mechanisms and softly humming runes. Four smaller crystals—one a pale blue, another a deep red, the third a swirling green, and the last a rough-hewn brown—are set into adjustable brackets along the frame. Etched glyphs, some weathered and chipped, spiral along the metal arms, each symbol representing a piece of an ancient elemental code. As the ship lists uneasily, you feel the unstable hum in your bones.

#### Mechanism Description

![[engine-room-mechansim.png]]

>At the far end of the engine room stands a heavy, brass-plated lever set into a metal console bristling with gauges and pressure valves. Twin pipes twist upward from the floor, feeding into a wide, circular apparatus etched with runic sigils that pulse faintly. A thick glass dome mounted just above the lever houses a swirling wisp of elemental energy, flickering between hues as the ship’s power waxes and wanes. Pulling the lever down will send a surge of arcane current back into the stabilized crystals, reawakening the ship’s airborne heart and setting its mechanisms back into proper motion.

**When the Engine is Properly Restarted**
>As the lever is lowered with a heavy “clunk,” a deep hum resonates through the deck beams. The pulses of light running along the pipes grow steady and bright, and the swirling glow within the glass dome solidifies into a stable, reassuring hue—perhaps a serene turquoise or gentle gold. The soft vibration beneath your boots normalizes, smoothing out like a purr. Overhead, you hear the rigging creak less urgently, and a gentle breeze of magically balanced air drifts across your faces, carrying away the acrid scent of malfunction. The entire chamber seems to exhale in relief as the ship’s lift stabilizes, and the distant sound of clean, even propulsion murmurs comfortingly from beyond the hull.

**If the Engine is Restarted While Misconfigured**
>With a strained groan, the lever resists and then gives way. Instead of a calming hum, the air is filled with a staccato crackle of unstable energy. The glass dome flares dangerously bright—searing white, then blinding crimson—before dimming abruptly. The ship lurches, throwing you off balance as sparks fly from the console. The acrid scent of burnt insulation and scorched metal assails your senses, and a sudden jolt ripples through the hull. The runes along the pipes flicker wildly and then go dark. The ship, robbed of proper lift, begins to descend erratically. You’ve triggered a system lockdown; the engine shuts down fully to prevent catastrophic damage, leaving you in a tense, airborne free-fall.

DC 18 con saving throw. 6d8 lightning damage on fail, half as much on success.

#### Intelligence (Arcana) Check

>You notice the flickering prismatic energy around the central crystal isn’t flowing correctly through the runic frame.

**For an Intelligence (Arcana) success:**  
>You recognize a delicate interplay of elemental energies. The pattern of glyphs suggests that the crystals each represent an element. Red fire, blue water, white air, brown earth.

**For an Intelligence (Arcana) failure:**  
>Your attempts to parse the glyphs only deepen your confusion. The symbols blur together, and you can’t pinpoint how the crystals should align.

---

#### Intelligence (Investigation) Check of the Engine

>You begin crawling around the frame, inspecting the brackets and tracks. A successful Investigation check reveals subtle scratches and worn grooves where the crystals have previously sat.

**For an Intelligence (Investigation) success:**  
>Your careful study of the mounting brackets and worn grooves reveals a pattern. Past adjustments left faint scratches indicating where each crystal typically sits. Following these marks, you can deduce a pattern: the pale blue crystal seems often placed to the north, while the red crystal’s mounting looks designed to align opposite it. 

**For an Intelligence (Investigation) failure:**  
>Despite your close inspection, the trail of scratches and grooves tells you nothing coherent.

#### Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) Check

>You notice the telltale signs of misbalance in the room’s environment. 

**For a Wisdom (Perception or Insight) success:**  
>You pause and listen to the hum of the engine and feel its gentle vibrations through the hull. In a moment of clarity, you sense that each opposing crystal must face the other, stabilizing the ship’s energy flow. Aligning the crystals in complementary pairs should smooth out the turbulence.

**For a Wisdom (Perception or Insight) failure:**  
>You strain your senses but can’t catch any reliable signals amid the chaos. The engine’s hum fluctuates too erratically to provide a clue.

---

#### Intelligence (Investigation) Check of the Room

> You begin looking through the crates and chests within the room.

**On success:**
>In an old foot locker you find a scrawled note that falls out of an old logbook that reads: *“Set the cycle so that Fire never stands beside Water. Ground the Air at the opposite horizon.”*
